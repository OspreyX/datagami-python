  "I received my sample of Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle last night and opened the bag today. And WOW! These were delicious and yummy!! They were like a light, crispy brownie. Sweet, but not too sweet. Definitely,would recommend these to all. And if I can find them locally, I will buy them. Great product!!\n",
  "My family and I thought that the brownie brittle was amazing, it reminds us of the almost burnt part of a brownie (which we love) and a chocolate chip cookie. The flavors are full and bold, and sweet and fantastic enough that we dont want to put the bag back into the pantry. As I type up this review one of my hands is inside the bag retrieving one of the cookies, and I think they are perfect. Getting that brownie craving taken care of without all the work. Love it. Definitely would recommend to all the chocolate lovers, brownie lovers, and cookie lovers, if you like all 3 youll love this!! ",
  "The brownie brittle was delicious! I wasnt sure I would like it because I tend to like a chewy brownie opposed to a crunchy one. The brownie brittle was so light and crispy it could melt in your mouth. I am hooked!",
  "I thought these were really great!  I&#39;m not crazy about brownies- they&#39;re fine, but not my first choice.  These were really fun though!  Mostly impressed by them because it&#39;s such a cool new idea!  I would recommend this product- especially if you love regular brownies.  Good for on the go as well. \n",
  "Omg chocolate chip brownie brittle is the best of the best I love it, love the taste, the crunchiness well I love everything from it not only that but I let my family try it and they loved it too, specially my 6 years old daughter...",
  "I just tried Brownie Brittle and amazing!  Great taste and crunch, the perfect snack.  Low sugar too!  So pumped to come home from cali with it waiting for me!  You gotta try it, made by Sheila G",
  "This stuff is to die for!!!  Althought it is more like a cracker then brittel, this is amazing!\n",
  "Dangerously delicious!  I wasnt really excited about these but I really enjoyed them!  They were chocolately and crispy...a great snack!",
  "I just received my brownie brittle by Sheila G&#39;s on Saturday. The bag is empty by Sunday. Myself and my 12 year old daughter ate the whole bag while watching movies. It is the perfect snack and they are so good. I received the chocolate chip, but now I want to try the toffee crunch and salted caramel. They really do taste like fresh brownies. Now I have to see if I can find them in my local Walmart Supercenter. They are even a WeightWatchers.com hot item. They do not taste like something you would eat on any diet that I know of. Delicious!\n",
  "These are truely AMAZING! It was a great little snack and so much fun to eat. <3 them! \n",
  "I fell in LOVE with theese. Everyone in my house fights over the edges of brownies when I make them. When I furst heard about Shelia G&#39;s brownie brittle I thought this woman is a genious. Each bite had the perfect amount of chocolate chips, it had that rich chocolatey taste of a brownie with a great crucnch. I will definatley be purchasing more and look forward tot rying the different flavors.\n",
  "Yummy,tis product was qctually good.Good size for a sample,I thought that. I received a gift from someone ,when I got it.My daughter thought that the taste does not match the texture,but I think that it is tasty ,but only bad thing is that I ate almost the whole box at once,it is adictive:)",
  "These are brilliant. I loved how they tasted just like brownies but had more of a consistancy of a cracker. They were nice and crisp. They had a great chocolate flavor. These are really good dipped in milk. I tried the chocolate chip ones, but I definitely plan on trying some of the other flavors, like toffee. The kids loved these too. I think all of my friends would like these for their kids or themselves.\n",
  "This was the MOST AWESOME SNACK!!!  My familiy devoured it!  It was light, crispy, but sitll was very chocolately and, most importantly, tasted like a brownie!  This is a DEFINITE YES!!  Go get these, you won&#39;t be disappointed!!!\n",
  "My daughter opened the box and immediately opened the  bag. Not only myself but. my husband and 3 children dug in and ate  a w pieces each. Everyone loved it.  My daughter says we have to find them in the stores so we can try the other flavors. Def. a great a snack, the flavor and the crunch I loved it.\n",
  "DELICIOUS!!!! These are the best quick natural snack that I have ever tasted. They taste exactly like the burnt brownie pieces from the pan, that I love!!!!! Low calorie and delicious make an excellent snack for chocolate lovers. I am already on the hunt for more!!!! Y-U-M!!!\n",
  "I loved brownie brittle. I think it is my new favorite snack. The only draw back was I wanted to eat the entire bag at once! It tastes just like brownie bits and I love that it is a lower in fat snack option - a guiltless pleasure that actually tastes good! I loved it so much I went out and bought another bag because the kids liked it too!\n",
  "This Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is absolutely amazing. Everyone in my family loved them. They taste like the crispy part of the brownie that you scrape off the sides of the pan. I would definately recommend this snack to everyone and cannot wait to go buy more since the bag didnt last even a whole day. I may have to buy a bag and hide it to keep it for myself.",
  "My children and I both enjoyed this product. It really tasted like brownies without any &#39;fake&#39; flavorings. I think I should clarify though that the name Brownie Brittle might lead people to believe that it is hard like peanut brittle which it is not. It is a thin slice of brownie that is crispy and taste great plus it had chocolate chips sprinkled about. We loved them and will look for them at a store near us!\n",
  "Holy cow! This has got to be my favorite swaggable item so far. These were so good my entire family was fighting over them. Im so glad the portion we got was sizeable. I would recomend these to everyone. Unless your on a diet, even then i might say try em lol.\n",
  "So happy to receive this product for review.  Absolutely delicious sweet snack when you want something a little lighter for dessert.  It was just like eating a crunchy brownie and friends agreed.  I would definitely purchase this on a regular basis.  Great product.\n",
  "This is an amazing product!!  Super yummy and not like any other snack on the market!  If your favorite part of the brownie is the crispy edge, you will love this.  If you just love chocolate, you will love this!  Can&#39;t get enough of this delicious snack!!!\n",
  "I got this in the mail before going on a camping trip. I thought it would be a nice addition to take around for when we were hiking as a fun snack away from our normal stuff. The tasted like great like a chocolate chip cookie. They were more crunchy but were fantastic will be something we will be getting again a fantastic product with a great chocolate taste.\n",
  "Great Product! I received them in the mail today and i couldn&#39;t wait to open a bag and give them a try. They weren&#39;t too sweet. They taste like the almost burnt part of the brownies I bake at home. I would recommend these to everyone.\n",
  "Just recieved Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle and they are so yummy!! My kids and I are truly amazed how delicious these are.  Love them!!!  I love the fact that they are made with all natural ingredients.  Way to go Sheila G, you made a fantastic product, Thank You!!!\n",
  "I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product. I actually hid the bag in my room so no one would find it. I didn&#39;t expect it to taste so good, but I was pleasantly surprised. It tastes just like the edges of a brownee, only crispier - sort of like a chocolate potato chip. The only problems I have is that it contains corn & soy which are known GMO&#39;s & I&#39;d like to know exactly what natural flavors are. But other than that, it&#39;s delicious. If I see it in the store, I will definitely buy it. So the crumbs won&#39;t go to waste, I&#39;ll be sprinkling them on ice cream. Good job Sheila G!\n",
  "I really like these. They taste like crunchy brownies.They are sweet but not too sweet and crunchy but not too crunchy.Great low calorie snack.\n",
  "I love Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. They are crispy but not to hard to chew. I wanted to eat the whole bag at once. Amazing taste. Just the right amount of brownie. They make you feel like your eating a brownie with out the whole heaviness of a whole brownie. You just have to tell your self to only eat 1 serving and not eat the whole bag at once. I truly love these brownie brittles. Rich and chocolaty. Once you open the bag you get that fudgy brownie smell and the best part of the brownie is inside.\n",
  "If you want a crunchy chocolate treat then Browny Brittle is for you. This delicious snack will fulfill any chocolate craving. The crunch is fabulous, the flavor is amazing. This snack left my family asking for more. This is a must try!",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle Chocolate Chip...WOWSERS!!! these are so good, so happy they gave me two bags because I love them! I am totally buying these soon, they are so tasty and I love the crunch!! They are perfect they are not too sweet, they are just right! Best of all they are made of natural ingredients. My husband and I are excited to try the other flavors! I recommend these to all choco-holics!\n",
  "WOW!!!! i have to be honest, I have tried this brand before (different flavor) and hated it! After trying the sample of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle I was completely blown away. amazing flavor and i love the crispiness. Everyone in my house hold fought over the crumbs!!!\n",
  "YUMMO!!! These are absolutely delicious.  I&#39;m thanking my lucky stars they sent two bags because they are almost impossible to put down.  They are light, crunchy and airy with chocolate chips spread throughout.  They&#39;re fun little bite sized squares.  I love the mix of the soft chocolate chips with the crunch of the brittle.  I did not expect these to be SO good.  I can still taste the chocolate after I have put them away and I think I&#39;ll just sneak one more. \n",
  "Bascially potato chips made of chocolate. They were VERY good especially when they have extra chocolate chips. My kids adored them. My only issue was how easily they broke. They made a pretty big mess but the whole crisps were very good.\n",
  "omg i jus got mines n now im eattin them they r ssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooooooo good\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is addictive! There are four servings in one bag, but I could&#39;ve eaten the whole bag in one sitting.\n\nThe chocolate makes me crave it more. The crispiness is fun. And each bite tastes homemade.\n\nI love it! Individual serving packs would be great, too, for when I have zero self control.\n",
  "Taste is great. Crunch perfect, the only downfall is that some of the pieces had an abundunce of chocolate chips and the other half didnt have any. Other than that these are great! Not a health food of course but perfect if you have a sweet tooth like myself.\n",
  "OUTSTANDINGLY DELICIOUS!!!!! Just the right amout of crispy texture and tons of chocolate!!!  I tried the chocolate chip fflavor or free from Swaggable and I will definitely be buying this product! I can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors! \n",
  "I recieved my Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle sample in the mail today.. They are AMAZING.. Love them.. They dangerouly delicious...lol  \n",
  "This is not the first time I&#39;ve had brownie brittle - but each time is just as wonderful.  They&#39;ve created something fantastic here.  It actualliy tastes like a brownie, but is light like a crisp.  And most importanly, I don&#39;t feel bad having some!\n",
  "These were to die for!!  I was craving something w chocolate the day I recieved the samples.  I definitely will be buying these.  I want to try the mint chocolate chip since thats my favorite ice cream.  thank you!\n",
  "I love these they have the right amount of crunch and the flavor is so delicious",
  "This is absolutely amazing!!!  Great flavor, great ingredients, great texture.  I am so happy with the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle I can&#39;t say enough good things!  It is exactly like the delicious crispy edges of a brownie.  It&#39;s low calorie (the entire bag is 480 calories!!) It&#39;s a perfect sweet tooth satisfier without blowing a diet!  Will definitely be buying these again and again!\n",
  "I had never tried this, I&#39;ve heard of it & heard good things but as you know everyone has their own unique palette. I loved this! It&#39;s an innovative food product, who&#39;d have thought to just take the crisp edges of the brownie? & The name is genius. I received the chocolate chip flavor, & two bags to sample, I was pleasantly surprised by the sample size.  Brownie brittle tastes exactly like the crisp edges of a brownie. I myself enjoy eating the edges.  it has a scrumptious chocolatey taste. I shared with my Mom who also loved it. I would recommend buying this to everyone, kids are sure to love it as well. & at 120 calories per serving it&#39;s a great snack for everyone. \n",
  "Delicious! Just plain delicious!\n\nThe texture is that of a brittle but it is not hard at all and just melts in your mouth. It is even better with a glass of cold milk. It is not over-sweet and the smell reminds me of fresh baked brownies!  I recommend these to anyone who loves brownies but never has the time to make them.\n",
  "I just received brownie brittle and can I say I love it so much more then the traditional brownies, giving a chocolatey crunch to the brownies is very delish, and looking at the health content I am astounded, everyone should try this product!",
  "OMG yummy I could eat this all day! :) This is brittle on a whole another level it just gives you that chocolate kick right away. I love this product.\n",
  "I love trying new things.Are you are looking for a snack thats crispy but yet light, brownie brittle is it.It has just as much flavor as a home baked brownie.This is the go to snack.",
  "This is one of the best flavored &#39;brownies in a bag.&#39;  It has a crisp crunch like a cookie, yet tastes like a brownie.  I will definately be buying this in the future!\n",
  "I tried these and loved it.\n",
  "These are SO Yummy! I think I am addicted! I like how these brownie bites are thiner than another brand I have tried before so these don&#39;t hurt your teeth ( or make you afraid of breaking a tooth)!\n",
  "I love that the brittle thas a strong brownie/chocolate flavor! I don&#39;t know anyone who does not like the the edges, therefore that makes this product a must have, all the edges are  in the bag. I wish I would have know about it before :)\n\nSuper crunchy just like cookies, with awesome brownie flavor, and the chocolate chips are an added bonus. I can&#39;t wait to try all the flavors! This would be a 5 star product in my book :)\n",
  "OMG, rec&#39;d our Chocolate chip brownie brittle today and it&#39;s unanimous in our house...Buy more mom! The taste is amazing, nice and crunchy, yet the best taste of rich brownies! The rich chocolate flavor would be absolutely amazing with some walnuts or pecans added in....but for the regular chocolate chip fans, you won&#39;t be disapointed! They are amazing and I will be looking for them in our market! Thanks for the opportunity to try these little pieces of goodness!\n",
  "I love these chcolate chip Brownie Brittle,they are very crunchy and have a rich chocolate taste!\n",
  "OMG. The #BrownieBrittle is Ah-MAZING. It is seriously like a crunchy perfect rich brownie with low calories/serving. LOVE. #GotItFree \n",
  "These tasted really good. I love that it had a little bit of crunch but it wasnt dried out like a burnt brownie corner might taste like. I also liked the sample size. It was big enough for an honest review and it didnt make me feel guilty when I ate it all :). Hands down one of the best things I have ever tasted. ",
  "Really liked these, super yummy! Like the crisp to them. I recommend this ",
  "The taste is suberb. Easy to go and you can eat wherever you want. I highly recommend this. It is a awesome great taste brownies. Yummy!!!\n",
  "These were really good.  Surprised I&#39;m not the only one that loves the crunchy bits of brownie left in the pan.  If I didn&#39;t feel like making a batch of brownies myself, I would definitely buy more of these.\n",
  "Ok so I got these in the mail today and one bite has me hooked. They are as rich and chocolatey tasting as a real brownie without the fat and calories. They have a great crunch to them I am already planning to buy the Caramel flavor on my next trip to the store.  I am so pleasantly surprised by these. I just hope I can stop myself from eating the entire bag so I can I guess, share with the family. \n",
  "I recieved Brittle Brownie and it was absolutly delicious.The taste was great and so was the after taste.I think it was a great idea to come up with this fabulous product.Then they give you .50 cents off your next purchase,and i will definetly take advantage of that.i loved it,my son loved it,and my boyfriend loved it.It&#39;s a wonderful snack for everyone.thanks swaggable for that experience,I hope i get another chance,cause your products are great.\n",
  "i love the brownie brittle that i got from swaggable the taste was so good i had to share with a few friends i would recommend this to every one love the brownie taste in a bag without baking it i would buy this for sure thanks swaggable for such a great product\n",
  "Oh my gosh!  Brownie brittle is delicious!  My husband and I have been fighting over this for the past few days.  He eventually stole it and pigged down the rest.  ",
  "Oh my! I just received my free sample and these are wonderful!  Crispy, chocolately, and decadent.  My whole family thought they were great!  If I saw these in the store I would definitely buy some.  \n",
  "I&#39;ve never heard of Brownie Brittle, so I was curious what it would be like. Sadly, I wasn&#39;t able to try it, since I&#39;m vegan and it&#39;s, well... not. I passed it along to my mom, who was more than happy to take it off my hands. She LOVES chocolate and was excited to try it. (She was also very impressed by the size of the sample, considering I received it for free.) She ate some of it with her daily cup of tea and said it was very chocolately and had a nice flavor. She liked that it wasn&#39;t loaded with calories too!\n",
  "This stuff is seriously delicious!  I LOVED my bag of Sheila G&#39;s Brwnie Brittle in Chocolate chip.  They have other flavors too - I plan on using the coupon enclosed in my Swaggable free sample package to get some of the toffee flavor.  This is the best possible combination of crispy cookie and chocolatey brownie flavor.  My favorite part of the brownie pan is the crunchy bit in the corners - this has a texture similar to a Pepperidge Farm Milano cookie but with the irresisitable fudgey taste of a brownie.  The chocolate chips are huge and visible and the brittle is only 120 calories and ounce - you can eat several pieces without feeling guilty!  Thanks so much for letting me try them - I&#39;ve found a new favorite sweet snack!\n",
  "I think it is tasty.  It doesnt feel like a heavy cookie.  After eating a few I feel like it is still light and crips without the unhealthy feel you might have after eating too many brownies or cookies.  I will def buy and recommend this product.",
  "Do you love the crispy edge of brownies? Just like the crispy bit of batter on the outside of a corner square, Brownie Brittle is delicious! It&#39;s very light and has a rich chocolatey flavor. It would be the perfect dessert for a sacked lunch. When I see these in the store I will be making a purchase. \n",
  "WOW! i loved the concept of these! THEY were soooo good!! i will def tell ppl about them and buy some more myself!!\n",
  "I got my Samples of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle today and just couldn&#39;t wait to try them. Hello all chocolate lovers! These are Awsome! A very unique and tastey idea for a product. I have to admit i was scepticle about the product; but pleasantly surprised. Definitely will be around my home for those NASTY chocolate sweet tooth cravings I get. Thank you for this great opportunity Swaggable.\n",
  "To be honest, I was so excited that I ripped open one of the packages and ate it. I thought Hmm, this is like eating the crispy part of the brownie. Then I read the infomartion and the description and I laughed because it was spot on, it was exactly meant to be like the crispy part of a brownie. It was great and my 3 year old even stole my opened bag and hid it. The chocolately flavor is perfect and I enjoyed my other bag with refreshing milk. The brownies were fun, cute, and didn&#39;t make that much of a mess on my plate. Yes, I ate the crumbs too...why not? Thank you Sheila G . and Swaggable.\n",
  "The flavor is fantastic. It tastes just like real brownies. I really enjoyed the flavor and especially the  chocolate chips throughout the brittle. However, I have to say that my favorite pieces of the brownie are the soft, gooey pieces in the center. I don&#39;t care for the crispy edges so much, so the brittle isn&#39;t a good choice for me personally. Anyone who does favor the crispy edges will absolutely love this product.\n",
  "I really enjoyed reviewing this product. The taste was great. The brittle was crunchy but not hard. It definitely is a chocolate chip brittle. The flavor was rich and smooth. It was filled with chocolate chips. This brittle had just the perfect amount of crunch. It melted in my mouth, this brittle was great I would recommend and buy this product fully. ",
  "I thought these were so good the kids loved them they are crispy and chocolaty great i will be buying more of these\n",
  "I got my full size sample today and it was pretty good.\n\nFirst of all Im not much into brownies, no less the edges so this isnt a product Id buy for my household , however I do have positive reviews about it.\n\nIts not too sweet and not too light flavored\n\nHas alot of chocolate chips\n\nIsnt a hard brittle, its crunchy and non chewey for those who might use dentures\n\nsmells tasty\n\ndoesnt make a mess\n\nIf your into brownies and brownie edges I think you would like this. The insert card shows it comes in other tasty flavors such as mint chocolate chip, salted caramel, and tofee which sound so tasty.\n\nOverall,, I liked this product.\n\nIf you like brownies, you wont be disapointed in Shela G&#39;s brownie brittle.\n\n \n",
  "I love brownies, and I really love the left over pieces on the sides of the empty pan.  I love the fact that the product comes in so many flavors and that over all it isn&#39;t too high in calories.  The flavor and texture were wonderful.  The whole family torn into the bag and thought it was lots of fun.  The only problem I had was that a good portion of the product was smashed into tiny crumbs.  My son poured it over ice cream and made a sundae out of the crumbs, which he thought was the best thing ever.  Over all I will definatly be replacing it.  My Costco carrys it in a large bag so It is going on my list:)\n",
  "OMG!!! this is the best stuff ever. I love the taste.\n",
  "This was so good and so different. It will get people talking. Its so yummy!\n",
  "What else can I say besides WOW! I opened the package as soon as I got it out of the mailbox, and it became my breakfast. It has the perfect amount of moist brownie, and cookie crunch. I will purchase more of these as soon as I can find them in the store, they are worth whatever price they cost. If you have a craving for chocolate, THIS will satisfy it! They also taste good with milk, in fact, I&#39;m wondering if I can make these into a cereal? \n\nAnyway, 5 out of 5 on everything. Love these!\n",
  "I really enjoyed trying this brownie brittle. I really enjoyed the crispy texture and chocolate chip flavor. I would definitely buy more of these. I especially cant wait to try the three other different flavors.\n",
  "The brownie brittle was great. My kids and husband liked them too. I would buy these if I saw them in the store. I have already recommended them to family. Its the best part of the brownies, the crispy edges. Soo good.",
  "My family loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle so much! We finished it in one night! The flavor and texture was just right! Can&#39;t wait to go to the store to buy more!\n",
  "Got my bag in the mail about 20 min ago and it&#39;s half gone now.. trying to hold off on eating the rest so hubby can try some out..this stuff ROCKS..... chocolatey, crunchy... omg addictive... amazing\n",
  "These look like they would be pretty bland and boring but the flavor is actually great! Nothing like a little chocolate boost to get you through the day. They are thin and crispy- and they really do taste like brownies! The only down fall is that the serving size is measured in oz. I wish it measured in number of pieces- becasue its kind of hard to gage if you are counting calories or on a certain diet how many is a true serving. Overall, its a good snack!\n",
  "I absolutely loved these crisps. I enjoyed the amazing flavor of the brownie and the crunch of a chip! All 3 of my kids fought over it. I was surprised it lasted for a whole two days in my house. I would definitely recommend these yummy snacks. The packaging is nice and sturdy too. While a few of the bottom pieces broke the majority of them were whole. The bittom crumbs are great to add on top of ice cream or yogurt. YUM! Two thumbs up!\n",
  "THESE ARE AMAZING.....I COULDNT BELEIVE HOW DELICIOUS THESE ARE MY HUBBY EVEN LIKED THEM AND HE&#39;S PICK AND NOT A BIG FAN OF CHOCOLATE.....GREAT JOB THESE ARE HEAVEN I WOULD LOVE TO TRY THE OTHER FLAVORS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
  "The chocolate chip brownie brittle taste as described very crunchy and good. I would recommend it to my family and friends. I would most definitely buy this product.\n",
  "OMG this product is so good i love it and it actually taste like your eating the end of the brownies i will be purchasing this again i love how full the flavor is.\n",
  "Was able to try out this Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle and it was simply awesome and tasty! It&#39;s not hard but very crispy. My 5-year old and 3-year old enjoyed it so much that there wasn&#39;t enough for all of us.  Which means, Mommy and Daddy will have to go and buy another bag of this! \n",
  "I just recieved this today and OMG the Brownie Brittle is heaven!! I&#39;m an avid chocolate and brownie fan, so this product is definitely on my good side. The brittle part of the name threw me off when I bit into my first square as it just broke off like a cookie would. It&#39;s more of a brownie-cookie but it definitely lives up to its name and taste. I recieved the Chocolate Chip kind but am very interested in the Mint Chocolate Chip kind. \n\nI&#39;m going bring my bag to work with me for people to try and see if we can&#39;t get this product in the grocery store I work at. That is, if I don&#39;t eat all of it first. :P\n",
  "This brittle isnt only good but it comes in a convienent pouch thats reseaable.  My kids ate this up like it was real brownies.  They liked the crunchy element and they chocolatey taste.  This will now be a staple snack in my pantry.\n",
  "MAGICAL!!! I could have had another bag.  These are so good.  My kids loved them too.  I love the end pieces of the brownies, so this is brillant.  I can&#39;t wait to purchase a bag.\n",
  "Overall this product was okay. The flavor was more like coffee than chocolate. I am not a huge coffee lover so it didn&#39;t go over well with me. Other than that I enjoyed it.\n",
  "OH MY OH MY OH MY!!! I must say I was expecting a sample sized bag of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. It was a regular sized bag that showed up in my mailbox!! Everyone in my house loves brownies... and chocolate LOL We are usually fighting over the edge brownies.. but you DON&#39;T have to with these!! They are all so nice and crispy! They are not as hard as I thought they would be, but that is a plus! My boys did not want to stop eating pieces of the brownie brittle. I was excited to see that the calories were only 120 per serving!! That made my day! These are definitely good if you have a chocolate craving. Eat just a piece or two of brownie brittle, and your craving will be gone. I am really looking forward to finding the other flavors in the stores. I will definitely be purchasing these and I won&#39;t feel guilty about eating it here and there. I give this swaggable sample two thumbs up!! Thanks for allowing me to test out this product! You have found a customer for life!\n",
  "When I first opened the package the smell was just like chololate. The taste is awesome, tastes just like a chocolate brownie and the crunch factor just made me like it even more. My son is enjoying the great taste as well at this very minute. I can get carried away eating Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle, it is a good thing the calories are low. The natural aspect just makes this delicious treat all the better. If your a chocolate lover like I am this is a must try.\n",
  "Had a box waiting in the mail the other day. It was a full size of the brownie brittle! I was craving something chocolatey and this was perfect. they are like thin pieces of brownies from the corners of the pan. crispy, and very chocolatey. They had lots of chocolate chips in almost every piece. SOOOO good. Where do they sell these!? I need more.\n",
  "I would purchase every flavor of this product! Im so looking forward to trying some more of these. My family enjoyed it so much.. Good job would really recommend !!! Perfect to snack on with a glass of milk",

  "Shelia G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brittle are so good! I can&#39;t wait for them to come in the stores. They tastes great and not hard like some brittle can be. I would let my Family and Friends know about this product for sure. \n",
  "These are just Wonderful :)  They have a RICH brownie taste but with a CRISP COOKIE crunch!!!  They are YuMmY!  I would definitely recommend them to my friends.  \n",
  "I received my sample of brownie brittle today and wow, these are really good!  I love the corner piece of brownie and these taste just like that.  I was kind of expecting them to just be ok since they were named a hot item by weight watchers.  As an added bonus they sent me a whole bag not just a sample size (I am actually having trouble putting the bag down).  I will definitely buy other flavors as the toffee and the caramel sound great.  Mine are the chocolate chip and taste just like a brownie but they are bite sized and crunchy, definitely worth a try if you like brownies!",
  "Light crisp and chocolatey.  Perfect for that late night craving!",
  "SO YUMMY!  Tastes just like a rich brownie with a crunch!!!\n",
  "When I received my brownie brittle, I opened the bag and was pleasantly surprised by what I tasted. The brittle is delicious! It is relatively low in calories with 120 per 1oz. serving. This is a must product if you enjoy sweets but want to keep a slim waistline. These are so good, deep chocolate flavor without being candy sweet. My whole family loves them! I would definitely recommend these.\n",
  "Shelia G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is SO yummy! I love the rich chocolate flavor and light crispy-ness in every bite! I could have ate the whole bag in one sitting! I will definately be purchasing this in the near future!\n",

  "This just arrived today.  My mom and I enjoyed it for an after lunch dessert, and the flavor was amazing.  We both loved the crunch, and my mom&#39;s complaint was that she would eat too much of it.  I would prefer single-serving bags.  I like that it is all natural, and it is a very nice treat.  I highly recommend it.\n",
  "i love it my husband loves and so  do my kids   we all now have a new favorite brittle\n\n \n",
  "Great snack that curbs chocolate cravings. This is a great treat when you&#39;re looking to satisy chocolate cravings. The brittle breaks easily and tastes like fresh brownies. The chocolate chips in the brittle are an amazing surprise. The snack size is great to take to work and have an afternoon pick me up. \n",
  "I absolutely love the Chocolate Chip brownie Brittle that it was gone in an hour. At first it didn&#39;t look to appetizing but omg very good. This is a must to buy. I did find that it&#39;s sold at Bed Bath and Beyond. It&#39;s very chocolatey but not too sweet. I can&#39;t wait to try more flavors. \n",
  "This Brownie Brittle is absolutely AMAZING! They are so chocolaty and delicious and when eating them it doesn&#39;t feeli like you&#39;re overdoing it! Great product!\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was very good, and was so chocolatey. I am going to use the coupon I got to buy some more of it.\n",
  "I received my complimentary sample of Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle a few days ago. I was expecting something a little different. This is no hard brittle, these are more like brownie cookies and I loved them! They taste just like brownie edges ( my favorite part ) without the burnt taste. And they have visible chocolate chips in them which was great. I can only hope I can find them in stores, I would love to buy more!\n",
  "OMG DELICOUS CAN I HAVE 7 MORE BAGS?!? These taste exactly like crunch little brownies. I would equate them to dried out little brownie chips. They are super chocolately just like I like my chocolate. lol. Totally worth picking up a bag to check them out \n",
  "the brownie brittle was very tasty it was like a party in my mouth\n",
  "These brownie brittle was the best I love them and they go so good when you put them in a glass of milk its just so delightful. I cant wait to try some different flavors you have to try them great stuff",
  "I&#39;m not gonna lie when I first got a request to try brownie brittle the name kind of turned me off. After received the product and trying it though, all I can say is WOWWWW! This snack is soooo good. It taste&#39;s just like a fresh baked brownie out of the oven. I&#39;m not lying when I say that either, try it for yourself and I promise you will not be disappointed. I also appreciate the fact that I received two bags of it and a $.50 off coupon. They have chocolate chip, toffee crunch, salted caramel, and mint chocolate chip. I received the chocolate chip and my family and I consumed them in minutes. I am not on the hunt to try the salted caramel. Not to mention it has only 120 calories per serving so its not very fattening either. Great job Sheila G!\n",
  "this morning i received my sample of Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle,opened the bag. And WOW! These were tasty!! They were like a light, Definitely,would recommend these to all. And if I can find them locally, I will buy them. Great product!! and especially my daughter loved these.thankyou\n",
  "Great portion size!   Yummy taste! oils buy again if I could find them again if readily available at grocery stores! ",
  "They were actualy a surprise in the mail. The looked amazing on the pack. The smell when you open them is definately an amazing aroma of chocolate brownies. I was confused at first how they would look and feel being called Brittle. A piece of chocolate as hard as brittle would not be appericated. But luckly once I bit into a piece, I found that it was everything I wanted in a brownie and more. The chocolate flavor is great, not artifical not like the cheap flavored chapsticks. The chocolate chips on top were a delightful surpise. The texture is light and fluffy as well as keeping a nice crips bite to it. Its amazing its all natural and such a good choice for a light snack when you need something sweet. These are amazing!! \n",
  "Loved these. Super chocolate and love the crunch. I would love to buy this product in the sample size for lunches and on the go. ",
  "this was such a new and fun product i love that its crunchy and flavorful i cant wait to try their other flavors especially the salted carmel and toffe crunch yum yum nom nom nom!!!! i would def reccomend this great snack!!!!\n",
  "3 out of 4 of my daughters like them the  1 that did not said they needed more chocolate flavor to them I would most likely buy them again",
  "OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI received my full size sample of Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle and I am so in shock! This is by far one of the best sweet treats I have ever had! It is  perfect and makes the taste buds just dance! It is perfectly textured, just the perfect amount of chocolate and its crispy!  It came with a coupon which ill be using  immediately to get more, and cannot wait to try the other flavours! This is my new night time snack wioth my hot tea this Fall and Winter season...! And this will be great to even use for toppings with the whip cream on Hot chocolate! Great job!\n",
  "I&#39;ll be honest, when I got my sample of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle, I was a little skeptical that it would be good because I usually prefer the middle pieces of brownies, but I figured it might not be too bad, so I tried it. Holy cow, this stuff is SO GOOD. It&#39;s made of chocolate and magic. And possibly crack, but mostly chocolate. Delicious chocolate. I can&#39;t seem to stop eating it and I am really hoping my local Hobby Lobby carries it because I am almost out. If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, you need to. The only downfall is that the major chain grocery stores don&#39;t carry it yet. Once more people try it though, I bet it will be easier to find.\n",
  "My boyfriend loves brownies, so he was very excited to see two bags of Chocolate Brownie Brittle. He immediately opened one of the bags andtook a big bite! He had a huge smile on his face and told me he was a fan. Only 120 calories per serving, low sodium, peanut free, certified kosher, made with natural ingredients, this is a perfect snack for anyone! It was also named as a great WeightWatchers snack. \n\nBrownie Brittle comes in 4 different flavors. I was sent Chocolate Chip, but there is also: MInt Chocolate Chip, Salted Caramel, and Toffee Crunch. I have a feeling I&#39;ll be on the lookout for Toffee Crunch on my next trip to the Grocery Store. \n\nThank you to Swaggable for allowing me to try such a great snack!\n",
  "Personally, my favorite part of the brownie is the soft, chewy middle, so for me, these weren&#39;t as satisfying as I hoped they would be. They kind of reminded me of the burnt pieces of brownie stuck to the pan that you scrape off and eat. They were really, really crunchy and kind of crumbly and almost too light in my mouth. Though I didn&#39;t like the texture, the flavor was really great and I loved that they put chocolate chips in them. I also really liked that they are only 120 calories/serving, and the airy texture makes it feel like you&#39;re not over-indulging yourself with something overly sweet. Overall, I liked the taste but not the texture - However, if you&#39;re a fan of the crispy edges of brownie (and I know most people are) I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll love them!\n",
  "Omg I ate this right away when it first arrived. It&#39;s so good and crunchy and it&#39;s exactly what it says. It taste exactly like the end of the brownie, the crispy part of it. It&#39;s sweet enough that it doesn&#39;t make you sick and I really liked this a lot. If it&#39;s in the local stores. I&#39;ll buy it since the price isn&#39;t too bad and it&#39;s extra delicious. I recommend this for anyone who loves brownies and chocolate. It&#39;s also Kosher so if you are jewish this will be good snack to have. :) \n",
  "We received our brownie brittle today.  It was really good.  A yummy chocolate snack.  The kids loved it and wanted more!  My hubby really liked it too.  He said it wasnt too sweet.  Depending on the price in stores we would purchase as a snack.  ",
  "This was an awesome snack. I really liked it. Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is really. I may be odd but I usually avoid the edge pieces when it comes to brownies. This is like the crispy edges of the brownies and its just like that. They are little rectangle pieces of crispy chocolate goodness! My 1 year old really liked. She kept asking for more. Its a unique idea and it is great. I appreciate that its made of natural ingredients. 120 calories per serving as well so win-win situation. The only thing I don&#39;t like is the crumbly crumbs that&#39;s in the bag because of the crispy pieces but I can deal with that. I would def recommend this for others.\n",
  "I receaved my Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle in the mail today and I could not wait to try them. I loved the fact that when you oppen the back they smell like fresh cooked brownie&#39;s.  Now I&#39;m one of those people that always  wont one of the corners because that is were you get that nice crispy piece ..... and boy these tast just like thats and i love them, they are not to hard you can not enjoy them they are just right .\n\n   I love the fact that we receaved two bags and a coupon , this is one coupon that I will be using soon I can not wait to try thier other flavors .\n\n It is great to see they are made with natural ingredeants. this is a must try .\n",
  "I was a bit disappointed, a few of them tasted a little burnt. Maybe a different flavor would be different, but i probably wont spend the amount of money they want for these.\n",
  "I love love love love brownie brittle. I had no idea what to expect, but when you hear brittle I know everyone things of peanut with the hard candy. This is the opposite its crispy, crunch, beyond chocolatey, and isn&#39;t hard to chew. Its like the edges of a pan of brownies. I hope I can find these around here because I think they have become my ultimate snack.\n",
  "After a long day at work I was happy to see my sample of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle at the door! I think this product is delicious and really satisfies my craving for something sweet and crunchy. It actually tastes like a thin crispy gourmet brownie! I would definitely recommend this product. Public Service Announcement: there are two servings per container so keep that in mind before you gobble these down. The brittle is really sweet so two squares were enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. This package will probably last me a week. \n",
  "Omg, these are the best things I have ever eaten. I gave some to all my friends and they all agree. They taste just like the crunchy part on regular brownie, very delicious!!!\n",
  "I have never been so impressed over a swaggable I have received.  These are so good.  I am so curious to try the rest of the flavors now.  I could sit down and eat the whole bag myself, and I am not big on chocolate, so this in itself is amazing!  Go out and get yourself a bag and you&#39;ll be happy!\n",
  "OMG OMG OMG. Where has this stuff been all my life? I opened the bag without being sure what to expect and immediately I got hit in the nose with BROWNIES. FRESH BAKED BROWNIES. And yes, this is like the best, crispiest bits of the brownie, distilled into a single bag. It is going to take a lot of willpower not to eat the entire bag at once (though it wouldn&#39;t be THAT terrible, calorie-wise, I suppose - but no). I am going to have to hunt these down and buy them often. Delicious. Amazing. I&#39;m in love!\n",
  "got these in the mail today and there yummy.,....\n",
  "One word sums this review up...YUMMY!!!!  These are SO much better than the pack brownie brittle that I have been purchasing at Costco!  They are light and thin and so tasty!  I wish I had more right now!  Perfect for a after dinner snack and on top of ice cream!  Can&#39;t wait to pick up another bag of these!\n",
  "I want to start with saying that a full-size sample of this product is not nearly enough to make me happy! i need an endless supply. THAT&#39;S how delicious this was! This has to be the first product i&#39;ve tried in a while that is made with all-natural ingredients but tastes amazing from bite to bite. It&#39;s crunchy, thin, and bite-size pieces make for an extremely enjoyable snack. I can&#39;t wait to find this product on a shelf in one of the stores i shop in. Highly recommend to everyone!!\n",
  "i love it ! brownie brittle taste like a cookie ! cripsy and yummy!!! great snack a must try and i will be buying these!!!\n",
  "They are delicious. My family and I really liked them.\n",
  "I really liked it. I thought it would be more candy-like, ala peanut brittle, but it&#39;s just like brownie edges. \n",
  "really good crunchy perfect as snack not too sweet \n",
  "My kids and I tried the chocolate chip brownie brittle sample that came in the mail today & love it! It taste like the crunchy party around the edges from when you make brownies ... A coupon arrived with the sample today and I think we will be making a trip to the store to buy some in the near future :)",
  "All I have to say is AMAZING! :)....It tastes exactly like brownies, I had a few of my family members try it as well and they loved it, Great product!!! :)\n",
  "I absolutely LOVED the Brownie Brittle which surprised me because i am not an edge of the pan kind of person.  They are a great lower calorie way to enjoy the taste of a brownie and you feel like you are not missing out on any of the flavor what so ever.  If I can find them in a store near me I will most definitely be buying more!\n",
  "If you like chocolate and love brownies, then this is for you!  The only way I can describe this Brownie Brittle is to say it has the crispness of a fresh chocolate chip cookie, but with all the flavor and scent of the most amazing fudge brownie you have ever eaten.  So yummy...I can&#39;t wait to buy another bag and try the rest of the flavors available!\n",
  "Wow!!! Amazing! These were absolutely delicious. My whole family enjoyed them. Will definitely be buying these in the near future! Thanks swaggable for my free sample!",
  "loved this product very tasty.  just like a crunchy brownie. i would highly recommend this product to all my friends. i will for sure be buying lots of this makes a great snack.\n",
  "so i got two bags of brownie brittle and opend it up put one in my mouth and well i am not a fan at all the only good thing that i liked about these is that they are a cute idea and easy to eat i wish they tasted alot better but my 3 year old loves them. Thats how you know kids will eat just about anything lol. I wish they were more tasty but they are not. Unless you like the dark chocolate taste and they are just about as dark as you can get.I however hate dark chocolate. \n",
  "It was so delicious and crunchy.it just melted in your mouth.",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is Delicious. There not hard at all, more like a chip really. These little bad boys are like eatting the edge of a brownie all the time. I wouldnt mind buying these for a snack every now and again, and if you haven&#39;t tryed them yet check them out there good. \n",
  "I was not sure what to expect from this product but I loved it! I loved how crisp is is and the chocolate flavow was great. I would buy this again!!\n",
  "O M G  i GOT THESE BROWNIE BRITTLES IN THE MAIL `TODAY AND THEY WERE SO SO GOOD!! THEY WERE A HIT IN MY HOUSE MY KIDS LOVED THEM I LOVED THEM THE HAD A CRISP FEEL OF BRITTLE THE TASTE OF BROWNINE WITH CHOCOLATE CHIPS IN THEM. IT WAS SO GOOD THE KIDS WANTED MORE!! GUESS WE HAVE A NEW SNACK IN THE HOUSE!\n",
  "Today i recieved  my Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle Sample today...Boy  was i suprised  not 1,2 or 3  but i got 4 samples they  were very delicious i  tryed them with a icce cold glass of milk. Im going to try them again  Iwould recommend them to anyone that loves brownies  they are great for on the go. I liked that they  were small and bite sized and as i said im going to buy some very soon    great product and delicious\n",
  "YUMMY!!! Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate hip Brownie Brittle is heavenly. Taste just like a soft brownie but the crispiness of brownie edges. It wasnt hard like most brittles out there so my teeth are safe lol. This is definitely a treat I&#39;d give as a gift to family/friend/coworkers and to myself. They are addicting, my kids and I shared a bag and wanted more! The best part is that its only 120 calories per serving, peanut free and made with natural ingredients.\n",
  "I received the Choc Chip Brownie Brittle samples, I was very please with the taste and the amount you received in the package. The Brittle tasted like little choc. chip cookies, both of the kids really enjoyed them also.\n",
  "These are the best snacks I&#39;ve tried in a long time.  Every person in my household tried these and fell in love with them. The bag wasn&#39;t big enough for them!!!  The taste is great and the best way we all found to describe its taste is that  it tastes like the edges of the brownies.  They are fantastic, if you&#39;re looking for a new snack to try and enjoy brownie edges, you have to pick these up.  I will be buying these very soon.\n",
  "This is so fun!  Great for on the go and very little mess (obviously I have kids!).  I was not sure on the brownie brittle ( I do really like peanut brittle) and this was yummy and tasty!  I do highly recommend and it is great since it is creative and out of the box.\n",
  "Recieved my bag of Brownie Brittle today and opened the bag right away. My son who is very picky & reluctant to try anything dove right in!! He loved it!! I did as well..... We hid the bag so we wouldnt eat it all at aone!!! Definitely something I would buy!!!\n",
  "I just received this bag today, and was interested to see what the Brownie Brittle would taste like. The product is marketed towards people who enjoy the cripsy corners and edges of a pan of brownies. Typically, I enjoy the middle, so I didn&#39;t think I would like these very much. They&#39;re delicious! They&#39;re like crisp brownie cookies, and I&#39;m definitely going to keep my eyes peeled for these in stores!\n",
  "If you want to call the burnt-to-a-crisp cookies on the edge of a pan that you left in the oven for like 6 minutes too long brownie brittle because they&#39;re chocolate cookies, I guess that is what this is. They&#39;re okay, but crispy to the point of barely having a discernable taste which is problematic in that they kind of have a lot of calories for what they are. Also, a lot of chocolate chips, which is really all I tasted. Eh. Not a fan.\n",
  "This is really good! You know how when you bake and you get some parts that are xtra crunchy? Well this is just what it&#39;s like. The  brownie is really surprisingly good chisp and crunchy not burnt. Even the chocolate chips you&#39;d get the texture of it and you can taste it but it&#39;s not over powering. I had to stop myself from eating it all in one sitting LOL . I would recommend it. I&#39;m not much of a chocolate eater but I would actually buy this again. Product did not come smashed up so you&#39;d actually can still bite into it. Great product! \n",
  "Overall, I thought the Brownie brittle was great. I loved the generous amount of chocolate chips in each bite and was amazed that they really do taste just like the crispy edges of a brownie. Loved the fact that you get the crispiness of a chip and the sweet savoriness of a brownie. My two favorite snacks combined! Genius!  My kids loved them too and pretty much stole the bag out from under me. lol I would definitely buy them in the future. (and this time, hide them from my kids lol) \n",
  "These taste exatly like the much loved brownie edge. They were chocolatey and crisp. I would have loved to savour these but my kids and I ramaged through the entire bags like savages . My son who never likes chocolate kept coming back for more. This is one item we will be buying from now on. I love that they are made from natural ingredients. My one suggestion would be in the area of packaging , maybe a square tin of some sort to help the brittle keep it&#39;s square shape and make it able to travel better , we had a lot of broken piece, but that didn&#39;t bother us too much.\n\n \n",
  "I really enjoyed the brittle it was delicious and it was good that it was peanut free since I,m allergic  I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the sample it fed me and my husband I would buy it and recommend it",
  "Just recieved this product today! I am in love with it. The chocolate chip is the flavor I recieved. I love it completely. The tastes is great and the crunch makes it addictive. Do not let the name fool you with brittle, its crunchy but not unbearably hard. I am definitely going to be buying this in the future!\n",
  "This stuff is REALLY good!  It tastes like a really good, rich, chocolatey brownie..but it is flat and crispy.  I have never had anything quite like this.  It&#39;s a very unique product.  I would definitely purchase another bag or different flavors to try.  Delicious!\n",
  "I looove these!! They are so so good. Do you like to lick the batter of brownies?Then, t\\his is what you want!! These do not disappoint! I love the cruncy factor,and the chocolate taste. I can&#39;t wait to use my coupon at Wal-Mart and buy some more of these.\n",
  "Today these awesome Brownie Brittles arrived! Let me tell you..they are DELIOCUS! I am the type of person who never eats the center of brownies. I eat around the entire outter edge! What a blessing these things are! They are very addicting :).. however at only 6 pieces is 120 calories I can afforid to munch on them here and there.\n",
  "Brownie Brittle was very tasty! They were so crispy and light.  I would definitely recommend them to my friends!\n",
  "So good! I want more. I was a bit timid on the first bite, unsure if I would like it or not, I actually had the thought, this is like the burnt part left on the cookie pan on the sides of the cookies... well by the third bite I was ravanously in love with this product. I highly recommend. Ther are other flavors out there too!\n",
  "Video unboxing and review here\n\nI honestly don&#39;t know why they put an expiration date on the bag... These things will never last more than 5 minutes in my house... They are not too crunchy. Melt in your mouth! They are rich in flavor, but not too much that you HAVE to have a glass of milk to drown it. Very light weight. You get so much crunch for the calories. When I read that they were on the Weight Watcher&#39;s list... This big girl just began to cry. I an now a HUGE fan of this snack! I saw them at Sam&#39;s and will be picking another bag up on my next trip!\n",
  "These are amazing!!  They taste like the crunchy tops of brownies!  They really have a tasty homemade flavor to them.  I really like the yummy chocolatey taste.  I will definitely be buying more of these.  My kids wont stop asking for more of these.  ",
  "I received my Brownie Brittle and I must say I enjoyed this crunchy and sweet snack. It had the exact taste of a brownie and crunch of a cookie.I thought it was quite delicious and a great snack food!  ",
  "Omg! These are sooooooooo amazingly good! I ate the whole bag in under a minute :). It tastes just like brownies, and I love brownies.\n",
  "these were amazing! i shared some with a co worker at work and she loved them. we could not stop eating them. she asked me where i got them and i told her about this site and i told her i wasnt sure if they were in stores yet. also i saved some for home. my husband looked at them and made a funny face at first but then tried them and ate the rest of the bag! AMAZING they were. thank you for allowing me to sample them!! I would definately recommend them. I will be watching the stores for these for sure. I loved the fact that they were all natural.\n",
  "I recieved my sample fo Brownie Brittle in the mail today and I cannot get enough! I&#39;ve eaten almost the entire bag (whoops!) and that coupon will certainly be coming in handy. This is a delicious product I&#39;d recommend to everyone who prefers the crunchy edges of brownies- or heck, just anyone who wants a delicious treat!\n\nHere&#39;s a link to my full review on Blogger: http://anothermomanotherblog13.blogspot.com/2013/10/swaggable-review-sheila-gs-brownie.html#more\n",
  "Just got this today and we ate one of the bags. It was so good, we both loved them! It made a good snack and satisfied my sweet tooth.Saving the other bag for later but I recommend them to brownie and cookie lovers. Id buy them,thanks for the included coupon, I will be looking at stores near me!",
  "I could barley get this product home before trying it! The flavor and texture of this product is amazing. I am a big fan of the putter parts of the brownie pan and this reminded me exactly of it! Yum! ",
  "I just got my brownie brittle from swaggable today, needless to say I&#39;m munching on the last little bit now. My almost 2yr old son ate most of one bag, and it took all my self control to save some for now, lol. These are so addicting and yummy! It&#39;s a whole bag full of the crunchy, delicious edges of fresh baked brownies everyone seems to go for, I love these and Sheila G&#39;s has a new customer....soooo good!!\n",
  "These are amazing!  They are crunchy and a fun snack to eat.  I loved the sample size.  It was enough that my boyfriend and I could try plenty of them.  We both thought they were super yummy!  I will definitely be buying these soon.  They would be incredible on ice cream too!  Can&#39;t wait to eat more!\n",
  "My family loved this . It was delicious. The bag did not last 5 minutes . The taste was like eating a brownie. Looking where I can get them in store .",
  "Loved this.  I received a large bag and my sister-in-law ate it in one day.  I&#39;ve had the english toffee but I think that the chocolate chip is my new favorite. \n",
  "First of all, thank you Swaggable to sending a generous &#39;sample&#39;! I received a box with not one, but two 2 oz. bags of this brownie brittle! Plenty to share!\n\nFlavor: There is absolutely no mistaking the flavor of these. Just by opening the bag and smelling them, you can tell that it is nothing other than brownie! As the description says, it really is just like the crispy edge of brownies! For anybody who finds themselves picking at the crisp in the corner of a fresh pan of brownies, these are for you!!!\n\nOverall: I love that these come in a bag. Vert convenient and great for travel! I also like that they are cut into small squares. I&#39;ve got several nieces and a newphew that these would be great for! I would definitely buy these again especially in the other flavors that they come in! Yum!!!\n",
  "I wasn&#39;t really sure what to expect when I heard about brownie brittle. I honestly didn&#39;t think I was going to love it. Oh my gosh was I wrong. Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle is absolutely amazing! It truely has that brownie taste that we all have grown up loving. It has a very clear and delicious chocolate taste. I am actually not a huge fan of crispy crunchy brownie edges. I love the moist delicious middle of a pan of brownies. This brittle however is amazing. I absolutely LOVE that there is not a huge amount of calories in these delicious bites. Its almost like a low calorie treat but much much better tasting. I also love that that it is in bite sized pieces. It makes it very easy for snacking on the go with little mess. I absolutely loved this brownie brittle. I will definitely be purchasing this brittle in the future! \n",
  "I just got these in the mail today... they were a surprise when I got home today... and OMG I LOVED THEM! First... the aroma pulls you in... they smell like freshly made brownies.  Then... the flavor! The flavor is amazing. Very much reminiscent of the crispy edges of homemade brownies. Finally the crunch is great. Not too hard, not too soft. \n\n \n\nI can not wait to try the other flavors! \n",
  "I just received this day and got two bags!! Thanks so much this are very good. They also good with milk. There light and not to much.\n",
  "These are the BEST if you love the brownie edges this brittle is wonderful! Not to mention its a hot weight watchers item. It satisfies that brownie craving.",
  "AMAZING!!! I 100% LOVE THESE!! The smell is just as wonderful as baking a batch of brownies in the oven. At first I didn&#39;t think that they would have had such an amazing flavor but THEY DID!! I want to go buy 100 more bags of these because they are the perfect treat. I would trade all candy bars and chips for these. I think that everyone who likes brownies will LOVE THESE!!. So your orders from me is to go buy a bag and enjoy. \n",
  "I just got these today and let me tell you they are the best.  I received 2 bags which should be enough to share but forget that, they are mine!!!.  I can tell that the ingredients are quality and it really does taste like the crispy part of the brownie.\n",
  "I recieved this in the mail today I was super excited. My kids and I opened a bag and started eating they were crunchy and fresh. Not too sweet and went really good with milk. The portions of chocolate chips were right on. Which is a big deal for me because  think too much chocolate chips is to much. I would totally buy this I am actually going to get some Mint Chocolate Chip ones. I plan on sharing the other bags with family so they can try them. I would totally recommend them to eveyone and anyone. Best snack I have had in a while. Thank you for giving me the oppurtunity to try. My fiance says its like the ones his grandmother used to make. So for my family it was a big hit and we plan on buying more and I am even going to get some to add in my Christmas baskets this year.\n",
  "Today I received the chocolate chip brownie brittle. The bag read rich brownie taste with a cookie crunch.I thought wow. how could this be? I tasted the product to find that the descprition on the bag was extremely true, and I couldn&#39;t stop eating them. It combines the rich chocolate flavor of freshly baked brownies with a crunch. It doesn&#39;t just taste like chocolate, it tastes like a chocolate brownie. There is a difference in taste if you never noticed. The chocolate chips melt in your mouth too. I absolutely love this product. I would recomend it highly. It is delcious. Who would have thought my favorite snacks could be combined? I will deffinately purhcase this product in the future, and try other flavors!\n\nI&#39;m conflicted about the bag. I think the dark color reminds me of rich chocolate, but that the bag should be a brown and another color. I&#39;m not keen on the black.\n",
  "Its the best ever! Its like having a pan full of nothing but the cruchy edges out of the brownie pan!\n",
  "I must admit that I had to have my daughter take the bag from me... I would have consume it in one sitting.  Absolutely one of my favorite snacks now.  I love chocolate and this was just wonderful in taste and texture.   The chocolate was rich in taste and I love the crispness of the bites...the chocolate chips melt in your mouth as well.   I am so happy that I was given the the opportunity to try such a great product.\n",
  "I was very excited to try Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle. I love Brittle and brownies and to have them all in one is pretty awesome! When i firsted opened the bag all i smelled was brownies! YUUUMMMYY! lol and when i tasted them, My mouth started to water. These brownie Brittle are the best! its like pouring brownie mix onto a cookie sheet and cooking them a lil more then you are suppose to. I Would recommend to everyone that Enjoys Crunchy Brownie And/Or PEanut brittle. so Nummy! These are very good and I cant wait to Try MORE! LOVE THEM. Thank you for choosing me to try!\n",
  "I was so excited when my Brownie Brittle came knocking at my door today! I have to say, I was a bit skepticle, but when I opened the bag and tried them, I LOVED them! Of course, I love my brownies warm and gooey, but this was a great exception for the crunchie eater! They had enough brownie taste to make me wanting more! \n",
  "These were such cute little snacks.  I thought it would be all random little broken pieces of the brown brittle but it is actually all these small little squares.  It taste just like a brown but it crunchy like brittle.  The flavor is very good, not too sweet.  It is much better than I thought it would be.  The calories are pretty low consider these are brownies.  If you love brownies, brittle and especially the edges of brownies, you have to try these.\n",
  "oh how i love the brownie brittle i really though that i was eatiing the best part of the brownies  taste just like a home made pan of brownies when i say that my family of six went crazy over theese it was a hit now we are all ploting on which flavor to try next this is an awesome treat i would recomment it to everyone\n",
  "Amazing! These things were delicious and I will definitely be purchasing the entire flavor lineup. \n",
  "The brownie brittle was very interesting.  I reminded me of the crunchy outside of the brownie pan but still the soft middle.  It was a great combinatio and a great taste and fun to consume.  The only thing I would like to see is maybe trying gluten free flour.  Awsome product.\n",
  "Seriously how AMAZING are these things????  They have the great taste of freshly made brownies, but now I can eat them like a chip!  They kind of remind me of astronaut food but with flavor.  Very cool product I want more!\n",
  "OMG! This chips are the best , taste great, low calories and healthy. My family and I love it, we just already finished our sample and bought more. Hightly recommended \n",
  "its was sooooooo yummy.i love the idea, and its just the right amout of chocolate chips!!!!!\n",
  "Love Brownie Brittle!  They are pieces of the best part of brownies...the crispy edges.  Sweet chocolate chips throughout sweeten them up.  Before I could go back for more my husband finished the bag.  Cant wait to try the toffee and salted caramel.  Mmmmmmmm",
  "So yummy and fun! Crunchy big and little bites. And they all taste a little different! I love it! So hard to stop eating! thanks!\n",
  "omg are delicious,  my son lked,are good delicious.only one question where i can buy?\n",
  "I loved this!  The edges are my favorite part of brownies, so all edges?  I&#39;m there!  I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t have these in the house often because I see them being *that* addictive.  \n\nI loved the crispyness and that the brittle wasn&#39;t too sweet.  I&#39;d recommend these to brownie edge lovers. ;-)\n\n \n",
  "I was so excited to open this package of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle, omg, they are very tasty and addicting at that!  Love the crisp crunchy factor of these little bites of heaven, I can see why these were named best new snack product of the year by the national confectionery sales association, i also enjoyed the fact they came in a 4 oz. package so I could share with my husband and daughter.\n",
  "I had never heard of these before, but was truely amazed when I got them.  They are crunchy like a cookie and taste like a brownie.  They have a great chocolately flavor and loaded with chocolate chips.  They remind me of Christmas peanut brittle only made out of a brownie.  The name suits the Brownie Brittle.  They were awesome with a glass of milk.  I would buy these again!!!\n",
  "Oh my goodness! These are amazing! \n\nWhen you open the bag there is an immediate waft of chocolate. It really does taste like the crunchy edges of a brownie in a crispy cookie. Then you get a good bite of real chocolate chips and it&#39;s just so good I couldn&#39;t stop eating them. \n\nNew favorite sinful (but not too sinful) snack! I plan to tell all my fellow chocoholics about these. Highly recommend! \n",
  "Absolutely love the idea of having all the crunchy bits in a bag. Definitely feel much less guilty than eating fresh made brownies. It satisfies craving and feels less heavy. I like that it is made with all natural ingredients. It comes in a convenient package that could be resealed. However, I would have preferred the brownie brittle to be slighlty more moist and less sweet & more chocolaty bits. Other than that, I probably would purchase a bag if I was craving brownies and wanted a healthy alternative. \n",
  "I really enjoyed Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle sample.When i opened a bag you were hit with yummy chocolate flavor,chips were so deliecious i killed the bad in 2 minutes,absolutly love them!\n",
  "I so loved these brownie brittle chips/cookies/snacks. My three year old & I had to try it right away and we didn&#39;t stop eating them. My 15 year old came home & he started eating them & the next thing I knew, I said can I please have the bag back now & he showed me that there was absolutely NONE left! I wasn&#39;t happy & now I want more but have not been able to find them. I saw on the coupon we have that they also make a mint chocolate chip type & that one sounds scrumptious too. I can&#39;t wait to give the others a try. Basically they are good for all ages due to the softness of brittle it just melds in your mouth & doesnt have a really hard crunch to them. They are very flavorful & the chocolate chips are real and yummy too!\n",
  "We received the sample of Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle in the mail today.  Both 2 oz packages have been demolished!  I am definitely a chocoholic and my children follow in my footsteps.  The flavor of these is addicting, both chocolately and flavorful. \n\nAs far as brownies go, I prefer a chewy moist brownie over the crunchy edges replicated by this product.  However, I can&#39;t fault this product for not being the type of product I would gravitate towards.  The texture is appealing and it&#39;s less messy for the little ones :)  This Brownie Brittle is available in 4 different flavors and all seem equally appealing.  My children already have added the coupon that came with the sample to my wallet for use on a future shopping trip.  I&#39;m not sure what these retail for, but would possibly consider them (especially with the right sale price and coupon) on a future shopping trip.\n",
  "I like it but its too sweet. I love it being crunchy and brownie flavor. \n",
  "These were a hit with my family and my kids friends. They smell wonderful and taste like brownies. I would definitely purchase these for my kids they were great.\n \n",
  "I LOVE these!!! I was surprised when I got the sample in my mailbox; I thought it would be in a small, single-serving sample package, but the bag was full-sized! These taste awesome. Just like the crispy edge of a brownie. Really excited to try all of the flavors!\n",
  "I love it, being crunchy, brownie flavor, but i wish its not too sweet. Or maybe if i will eat it with tea or milk. Its  a great snack to go. \n",
  "These where so yummy my family loved this they finished the bag in less than a hour they were so light and crispy would definitely buy more jn tje future.",
  "I wasnt sure what to expect with these. I tend to go for the inner brownie pieces, you know, the stickier, doughy-ier pieces. I was pleasantly surprised by these crispy chocolate treats! They satisfied my crunchy, sweet, and chocolately cravings all at once. In that respect, I would recommend this snack to someone who likes sweet stuff but is trying to eat fewer amounts of it. If I saw this brownie brittle at the grocery store I would pick it up for sure. ",
  "My family and I were very excited to try this product when it arrived. I expected it to be as hard as traditional brittle but was defintely surprised by how crispy and great tasting the brownie brittle actually is. Needless to say, it was a major hit in my family & we will defitnely be buying this in the future.\n",
  "I received the #Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle in the mail today.  I was not convinced that brownies could be packaged in a bag.  Well, brownie brittle is delicious.  It is crunchy and sweet.  It really satisfies the sweet tooth and the need for a crunchy snack at the same time.  I am going to look for these in the store and try differetn flavors.  Thank you #Swaggable\n",
  "I am vegan so I would not recommend this product. This was my first sample so I didnt realize that stating I had dietary restrictions wouldnt prevent dairy products from being offered to me. I promptly handed the bag over to my father & brother who loved it. My father started snacking and said, Its good.. (head nod) tastes just like a brownie.\nI wish they wouldnt advertise foods containing egg & dairy ingredients as natural. It is not natural for humans to eat these things. It is natural for a calf to drink cows milk & for eggs to be born into chicks. Now if this was a cruelty free company producing vegan brownie brittle I would jump to buy it & spread the word. ",
  "I received these to try this weekend. They were amazing! My family loved them! I thought they tasted like the burnt end pieces of brownies that everyone loves. My husband said the brownie brittle tasted like a cross between a burnt brownie and chocolate chip cookie. I thought they were going to be too hard to eat since it was called brownie brittle, but shockingly they were not too hard and had the right amount of crunch.They had a rich chocolate taste. I love the fact that these are peanut-free, certified-Kosher, made with natural ingredients and only 120 calories/ounce. Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle is a snack that I can sharing them with family and friends without worring if it will fit into their diet plan, \n",
  "This product was AMAZING!! it was the crunch The brownie parts you get accidently, but on purpose! The full size bag was an additional bonus and we doved it even more after that. I just wanted to keep eating them forever! Not to mention there was a coupon with the sample which will be put to good use come grocery shopping day.\n",
  "Delicious! I received this in the mail today and my husband and I ate the entire bag in less that 20 minutes.  I am not kidding! These brittle &#39;cookies&#39; were so good, we could not stop ourselves! They taste just like a brownie, but they have the crunch of a cookie. I loved them. I am hoping I can find these in store because I definitely want to buy a bag soon. Absolutely delicous! \n",
  "MMM.  These are so yummy!  It&#39; like eating a chocolate chip with chocolate chips!!!  I am for sure going to buy these.  They are thin (but not too thin) ;) and crispy, and have big chocolate chips in them.  I wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d like them, but I love them!  And I will def tell my family and friends about them, actually I already told my grandma.\n",
  "These were amazing!!! One of the best snacks out there in my opinion! I did a video review of these on my youtube channel and the link is below:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_SFRJinEMY\n\nI can&#39;t wait to buy the other flavors and try them out too! Best swaggable mission yet! Thank you Sheila G for allowing us to try your amazing product!!!\n",
  "Thanks to Sheila G`s Brownie Brittle.\n\nI tried Chocolate chip whic is rich brownie tate witha cookie cruch.Its yummy and delicious.The taste is awesome.What i like is that it is crunchy and same chocolate cokie with smallchocolate chips in that.My friend liked it too as it is penut- free and has natural ingredients.Its an awesoem Snacks and yummy chocolate pieces in it.!!\n",
  "These are really good!  They taste just like brownie edges, just like they claim.  I am not one of those people who prefer brownie edges to middle pieces, but they are still quite tasty!  I just got my sample yesterday and have already told several people about them!!\n",
  "We really enjoyed The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. I thought it was clever that they wrote no more fighting over the corner piece. Im not sure if the pieces were meant to have a uniform shape and size, but it was pretty broken ( which didnt change the taste at all). It was perfectly chocolatey, and nice to get a chocolate chip every once in a while. I think these will be perfect when you want something a little sweet after a meal or as a snack. The packaging was great.",
  "This was really yummy! Enough to satisfy a chocolate craving and no messiness. The crisp crunchiness and not too sweet made these perfect with a glass of milk. I would definently buy these again... seeing as this bag isn&#39;t going to last very long.\n",
  "I love this stuff!! It tastes just like a brownie with a crunch. I do have to admit though that it is addicting! I will buy this because I think its a great snack and it really satisfies my sweet tooth without indulging in a pan of brownies! This would be great to put out for a get together or party, I will definitely recommend this one! ",
  "These are DELICIOUS!! If you like brownies, and in particular the end parts that are a bit crusty, this is the dessert/snack for you. I opened the bag and ate the entire thing. Such a fun idea for a snack. LOVE IT!\n",
  "I just received Brownie Brittle today!I love it!I am so addicted to brownies and I always love the crunchy part,the best part but of course that part of the brownie seems to disappear first.Well no worries now!Brownie Brittle is just that!it taste like the crunchy part of the brownie,it is so good!My three year old wouldn&#39;t stop asking for more.I got to try the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle theres is nothing better than that.It is great for a afternoon or late night snack.There are 4 different kinds to choose from Chocolate Chip,Toffee Crunch and brand NEW Salted Caramel along with brand NEW Mint Chocolate Chip! here is my review on my blog\n\nhttp://yvettescreations.blogspot.com/2013/10/brownie-brittle.html\n",
  "These taste just like real brownies! If you ever get the brownie craving but don&#39;t feel like making a mess of the kitchen and bake any grab a bag of these. The chocolate chips add an extra delicious touch to them. Be warned though once you open the bag it&#39;s hard to put them down. Definitely picking up more of these everyone loved them.\n",
  "Within a day, this was gone! My family and I loved it! My nephews couldnt keep their hands out of the bag it was that good. I would buy this again and I would recommend it to everyone!\n",
  "I received the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle sample yesterday. They were so awesomely delicious! I have found a wonderful new snack. They are light, crunchy and very yummy! I will be buying more every week!! Just plain AWESOME!! I will recommend them to all of my family and friends.\n",
  "Let me just say...YUM!  I never heard of brownie brittle, so when this arrived in the mail, I was like COOL! lol.  it&#39;s got the crunch and the chocolateyness to em!\n",
  "You know when you want the ends of a brownie because of the crunch factor? Well look no further - this product is amazing. Every bite has the crunch factor. Its light and refreshing and a perfect pairing with a glass of milk or wine ;)\n",
  "These are great tasting. They&#39;re very light and just the right amount of sweetness. It&#39;s like a brownie cracker.\n",
  "Wow, I&#39;m hooked!  These are so good. It truly is like the edge piece of a brownie-- but a huge chip-like flake.  It&#39;s kind of like a cookie-brownie, but extra crunchy.  The chocolate chips were a nice touch.  I will definitely be purchasing these and the other varieties in the future.  Thanks swaggable!\n",
  "I receieved the chocolate chip brownie brittle yesterday. I expected more of a brittle, like hard candy but I was pleasantly surprised that wasn&#39;t the case! Although I wouldn&#39;t consider this a brittle at all, it was very delicious and had a great chocolatey flavor(my favorite part). They were very thin, very crispy brownie pieces! They almost seemed to melt in your mouth too. My kids adored these and already requested I purchase the mint ones asap!\n",
  "I loved these cookies, great light snack. Not a fan of brownies or cookies but these were really good. Love the crispness of the cookie. The chocolate chips in the cookies just melt in your mouth. My 3 year old also loves them! I would definitely recommend these to family and friends. Will be purchasing these.",
  "these are so good! they cured my chocalate craving!\n",
  "These little crisps are absolutely delicious!! It&#39;s really interesting though, because I usually do not like the crisp edges on brownies, I definitely go for the gooey centers. Some of the pieces have extra chocolate chips on them, which I love. They have a great crunch and really do taste like brownies, and I like that they are all natural. I will totally be purchasing some of the other flavors, and I recommend them if you are a brownie-aholic like me. \n",
  "I got this in the mail yesterday! I&#39;m one who loves the hard edges of the brownies and this is a great idea for a snack. It smell reminded me of freshed baked brownies and tasted just like one. I&#39;m excited to try the other flavors because the chocolate chip brownie brittle was great!\n",
  "So yummy!  This has such a good chocolate flavor and is so crunchy!  Its a neat idea and my kids loved it as well!  It has chocolate chips in it whoch makes it even better!  We would definitely buy this!",
  "I received the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle yesterday in the mail and I AM IN LOVE!!! I am the one who LOVES the crunchy sides of the brownie so these are delicious to me. I am definitely looking forward to trying the Mint and the Salted Caramel. Those sound delicious. I was so excited when i saw the coupon they sent, guaranteed i will be buying these 2 bags. I will be serving these at my holiday parties this year, as im not much of a baker and i know the family is going to love these.\n",
  "I would like to at the start thank swaggable for sending me a free bad of Shelia G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Browine Brittle! I recieved my full size bag 2 days ago and I am actually snacking on it now lol! It has a great flavor! It is like getting all the crunchy corner&#39;s of the brownie all to yourself in every bite!

I also like that it is also peanut-free especially with so many people in the world with an allergy to peanuts! It is yummo!! I will for sure being using my coupon to purchase more!!!\n",
  "sweet little treat !!! had to sneak the bag away from my girls !!! \n",
  "Love this product, I received the brownie brittle to sample, shared it with family members and everyone loved it. I love the soothing taste, the texture, and the appearance of the brownie brittles. I can eat a bag all by myself.\n",
  "These are sooooo good! I wanted more! They are crisp and cunchy like crackers. And are super chocolaty. I love the chocolate chips on top. This has got to be one of my new fav. snacks. I need to find some more. My bf and I were fighting over the last of them! Delish!\n",
  "I really loved the brownie brittle and so did my 5 year old daughter. I could not keep her out of it. I we loved the flavor really tasted just like a brownie. My favorite part of brownies are the crunchy corner pieces and this was the best thing in the world because it gave me that. Yes I would buy this product and plan on buying it. I definetly give this a 5 star rating and reccomend them to everyone who loves a sweet crunchy thing!\n",
  "im not going to lie when i first got this i didnt expect it to be as tasty or as filling as it is. Its totally satifisied my chocolate cravings with out eating the whole bag., this will be one of my new go to snacks its fanastic i defitenely think evryone should try this product and eat it\n",
  "Best Best BEST  stuff around. Bursting with a chocolate flavor. Delicious chocolate chips on top. Crunchy and cripy, and light and airy. It&#39;s not too hard. Like crackers. So good. Go get some! If you do, get more than one bag. You will want more! Very addicting!\n",
  "These are so good!! So delish! Go out and buy this if you love the getting the corner piece of a brownie! I can&#39;t believe only 120 calories! I will be buying more!\n",
  "Love Brownie Brittle its the good part of the brownie without all the middle getting in the way.\n",
  "These are sooooo good! They are crisp and cunchy and did I say soooooo goood!! \n",
  "This was completely amazing! They are almost the consistancy of graham crackers, and have little chocolate chips in them. They deffinetly taste like a cookie/brownie! I will deffinelty be recomending these to everyone, even my husband admitted hed be telling people about them too. My husband has already let me know that we WILL be buying some of these. They taste like a mix of dark (but not bitter) chocolate with a hint of milk chocolate, and deffinetly not to sweet. At 120 calories a pop i didnt mind sitting down and eating the whole bag (which probably isnt great to admit), deffinetly no guilty fealing AND they are all natural!!! A big plus when your trying to stay with all natural things with your children. While talking about my children, its a great add in, in my oldest sons lunch, he has also become addicted.\n",
  "We LOvE the Brownie Brittle!! tasts just like the crunchy edge of a sheet of brownies with added chocolate chips!!\n",
  "Sheila G was a genius when she created Brownie Brittle - the great cookie crunch with awesome brownie flavor. YUM is the perfect word to describe this sweet treat. Love that it&#39;s also made with natural ingredients. I&#39;ll definitely be buying these and look forward to trying the other flavors too!\n",
  "OMG! This is the perfect mix of a brownie and cookie. It melted in my mouth. If you want the taste of an awesome brownie without having to use a spoon you got it right here. I was excited to see the coupon, I can&#39;t wait to go but the different flavors!\n",
  "Oh wow, by far the best product that ever showed up at my door!!! ~ I planned on sharing this with my husband, ~ but once I tried it I hid in the closed and ate the entire bag.  Super delicious!!! ~ I would recommend this to anybody who is alive and likes brownies or chocolate, it was crunchy and delicious and had amazing chocolate chips in it! mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!  The only thing that bothered me was that it was a bit squished so most of it was crumbs, so I had to sneak out of the closet to get a spoon to get it all... ~ Oh ya and the bag wasn&#39;t big enough to fit my head into so I could lick the inside of the bag...\n",
  "I&#39;ve never heard of Shiela G&#39;s or even Brownie Brittle before, so I was definitely interested in a sample! It turned out to be simply awesome! It tasted great and looked even greater. It wasn&#39;t too hard or too soft. It definitely tasted like a brownie, but looked more like a cookie. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for this in my local store! I am definitely interested in tasting some of the other flavors and hoping that they are as good as the Chocolate Chip one. I opened this as soon I got it and it was gone within a day! It is THAT good!\n",
  "These Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittles were awesome! They taste just like a brownie! I would buy this again and again!\n",
  "I received brownie brittle chocolate chip.  I have to say this product is just ok.\n\nThey are lite and crispy but not filling.  I found myself eating the bag.\n\nI wish they were richer and satisfying.\n\nNo need to buy!\n",
  "Oh my word, best snack I have had in a VERY long time.  My 4 year old even fought me for the bag of brittle bits.  Loved the sample size that was sent as well.  I would totally buy this if I saw it on a shelf at the store.\n",
  "Well I got this yesterday, super excited because of the brownie and I was craving for it anyways. Sad to say it didn&#39;t live up, it reminded me of almost of  burnt cookies not burnt in looks yet but the taste was there. It was like bitting into a hard cookie and although the chocolate chips in it tasted great it still left the slight burnt taste in my mouth.\n",
  "great pick me up while on the go or a quick snack at work. Great tasting chocolatey goodness... must try the other flavors\n",
  "I was so surprised that this product actually tasted JUST like the corners that you would pick off of a pan of homemade brownies!! They are so yummy! They are crunchy, have chocolate chips and are only 120 calories per serving! They ROCK! As soon as my kids came in the door from school they tore into both pouches! Being peanut free and certified kosher these are awesome!!\n",
  "This stuff is awesome. You know that really great part on the pan of brownies?  The edges that are crunchy because they&#39;ve cooked beside the pan?  Imagine a bag full of THOSE.  This stuff tastes just like a brownie, but is crispy/crunchy like a cookie. The ingredients list allows me to enjoy withoug guilt (I&#39;m one of those snobs who only likes stuff made from scratch).  These taste like home-made goodness. Would definitely purchase!! \n\n \n",
  "Well this came in the mail yesterday and the whole bag is gone. We decided to put them on top of our ice cream after dinner and everyone loved it. The rest that was in the bag was eaten by my husband. It says that 1 oz of this is only 120 calories, and that is really awesome because this is something you can have and not have a guilty feeling afterwards. I plan to buy some of these for the holidays.\n",
  "The flavor we liked a lot because it is not very sweet, my favorite part was the crunchy and easy to open packaging.\n",
  "This delicious snack has all the best parts of the brownie, chocolatey goodness and the crispy edge texture without be loaded with calories. Loved this and will definitely purchase.\n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle sample is truly amazing! The crunch of a chip with the flavor of chocolate, what more could tou ask for!!!\n",
  "This Brownie Brittle is so good! It tastes just like the crispy edges of a brownie. I have no idea how they were able to capture that exact taste, but it is so yummy! I can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors, but the chocolate chip one is very yummy! If you prefer the soft, goey brownie, this might not be your favorite, but if you&#39;re an edge person, you need to try these! I would for sure recommend this, and I will buy this as soon as I finish my sample. :)\n",
  "When I first heard brownie brittle I thought that it would be a little thicker and tough on my teeth, however when I open the bag the peices were thin and not to tough. My kids would have eaten the whole bag had I left it down. I love the crisp texture and the flavor of the chocolate chips, however I  would personally like to see more choclate chips, but thats just me. Really good with milk, but I wouldn&#39;t reccomend dunking them in the milk seeing as how they fall apart. I look foward to hunting down the mint choclate chip brownie brittle( what a mouth full, lol). I haven&#39;t had a chance to look for them, but I&#39;m sure WalMart will have them. The fact that they are made with all natural ingredients is jut the icing on the cake, or the chocolate chips in the brittle, lol.\n",
  "OMG!!!!  I absolutely loved these crunchy, cripsy, chocolately pieces of heaven I received in the mail yesterday!!  I was in shock to receive two 2 ounce bags!  I shared one with my mom who just kept raving about them.  I can&#39;t wait to try Sheila G&#39;s other flavors.....especially the salted caramel brownie brittle and the toffee crunch. YUM :-)  So glad that there was also a coupon included in my box!!\n",
  "At first I was skeptical, but they were delicious. If you like brownies, you&#39;ll love them. They are a cross between a brownie and a cracker/cookie. Different, but very tasty!\n",
  "Wow these are super tastey! It&#39;s like a thin, crispy, light, not too sweet brownie. Definitely recommend it! \n",
  "Wow!  I really loved these! They taste great! Just like the brownie end pieces! My kids loved them so much we went and bought some. \n",
  "When I first picked up the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle bag I was skeptical. The bag was light in weight and I had the imaginings of those crusty bits of brownie batter that cook on the walls of the pan. \n\nI was SO wrong. The brittle is amazing. Something between a brownie and a light cookie, very chocolaty and not at all like the scrapings off the side of a dish. The chocolate chips were by far the best part. So good without being over chocolatey. And the way they are cut into cute little squares makes it easier to limit yourself to a couple of(or all of the) pieces. I loved them!\n",
  "crunchy! tasted like a chocolate chip cookie with a crunch.\n",
  "My family devoured them in less than 5 minutes lol. They are really very good.\n",
  "I loved(yep I gave one bag to my parents and ate a whole one by myself) them! They are crunchy brownies which combine my two favorite things: crunchy and brownies. I would definitely reccomend these to anyone who loves brownie, especially if they love the edges.They&#39;re great crumbled on pudding(that&#39;s what my parents did)  I probably would purchase these again but it&#39;d be a really bad thing to do because I love them so much. \n",
  "I love brownies so I was not sure if these would be as good as the real thing, but they are! I like that they are crunchy and they do taste like a brownie. The best part is they are so rich after a few pieces my chocolate craving was satisfied. I would recommend this and will be using my coupon to purchase another bag. I have not yet let my 2 year old sample it but I am sure it will be a big hit.\n",
  "These are awesome! If you are like me and like the crispy edge of the brownine these are just the thing for you. They taste just like a brownie should, nice rich chocolate brownie flavor. Only downfall I can see with these things is not being able to stop eating them and running out! If I can find this in my local store I would deffently buy it! Thank you Swaggable for turing me on to another awesome product!\n",
  "OMG  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Chocolage Chip Browube Brittle \n\nit is wonderful!  I was not sure how well i would like this since i am not a super huge fan of Choclate. it has an amazing amount of flavor they are not super sweet. its like eating a realy thin cookie =]  each peice has little choclate chips on top too .  if you have not tried these yet go run to the nearest seller and buy tons of them trust me you wil go through a whole bag before you know it.  i have to try the otehr flavors now Thanks Swaggables \n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle is my favorite sample out of everything I&#39;ve received from Swaggable so far and this was no skimpy sample, either...it was a full sized 4 ounce bag.\n\nThese really do have the taste of a rich, decadent brownie in a crisp cookie form.  I love the crunch...I was afraid they would be rock hard but they aren&#39;t at all, they are just perfectly crisp and delicious.\n\nAt 120 calories an ounce, these are extremely satisfying and almost guilt free.  After snacking on them, I was as satifsied as if I had eaten a traditional calorie laden brownie.  The taste is definitely there!\n",
  "Loved it! Was very sweet and chocolatey! My husband asked me to purchase them again! I just wish ou guys included more coupons :)",
  "I got the Brownie Brittle in the mail today and just had to try them. when I frist opened the bad O My Goodness!!! I could just sit and smell them all day. They are sweet but not too sweet. I love the crunchy part of brownies so they were perfect! I can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors. I would totally recomed these.\n",
  "They smell like fresh brownies and have a really deep, chocolatey flavor. Nice and crunchy but have a light melt-in-your-mouth effect. They are deliciously sweet, not too sugary. I like how they have LOTS of chocolate chips.\n",
  "the brownie was so delicous, i was very please with the size of the sample. i will buy these in the future.\n",
  "I received Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle and the first thing that I noticed when I opened the bag was the wonderful smell of fresh baked brownies! At first they looked a little odd, but the aroma made me want to eat the whole bag. Now one thing to note is that they are 120 calories, and serving size is 2... So looking at that it seems to be a great choic when choosing a snack or a craving!! Once you eat one it&#39;s hard not to eat them all!! Overall I think they are a great little snack and you can really taste the brownie flavor and I love the little chocolate chips too! Being made with natual ingredients is a huge plus also. \n",
  "The Sheila G Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is fantastic!  It really does taste like the crispy, delicious outer edge of a pan of brownies.  It has a great crunch and texture, just the right thickness, and the chunks of chips make each bite more decadent.  My whole family really enjoyed these a lot, and we will definitely be buying them in the future! Who would have thought that we could all enjoy the best of part of the brownie so easily!\n",
  "In looking at these, I wasn&#39;t so sure about them. I thought I enjoyed the crunchy edge next to the chewy center of a brownie. However, WOW! These way over delivered! So amazing. I had to FORCE myself to step away from the bag so I wouldn&#39;t eat them all in one setting.\n\nThe flavor is AMAZING! So good. Just like a delicious brownie with the perfect crunch! No doubt these are a new staple in my house. They are THAT good!\n\nRun to get some now!\n",
  "The product was tasty and reminded me of a chocolate flavored chip.  I like soft brownies so the idea of crunchy pieces was a bit different, but they has a good taste.  The product claims to be natural but in the ingredients listed over 15 different items.  I know that that term does not really mean anything but just be aware of that.",
  "I received my sample of Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle yesterday and I have to say it was truly amazing.  I tend to enjoy salty snacks over sweet, chocolatey snacks but I can honestly say this was delicious.  One thing I liked was that this brownie brittle was not overly sweet like a lot of other chocolate snacks.  I loved the crunchy texture and liked the chocolate chips in it.  Will definitely be purchasing the mint chocolate chip as well as the salted caramel.  Can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors.\n",
  "The package arrived in a nicely packaged box. But sadly the brittle was broken to an inch pieces.\n\nIt tasted crunchy, had a nice chocolate flavor and is a good delicious snack.\n\nI wish I knew how the unbroken product would have been. I would buy this in a store but not online owing to the broken pieces.\n",
  "Yum very delicious. My whole family loved them. My husband says when we have brownies his favorite part is the outer crunchy part. We will be buying more of these very soon. Especially since our bag didn&#39;t last very long.\n",
  "These taste like the edges of the brownie pan, the best piece. They are crispy and have melt in your mouth chocolate pieces in them. I ate the whole bag in one sitting,they are that good.\n",
  "I am not a huge sweets lover so I brought my package to work to share with a coworker. I opened the package to try one out before I shared. By the time I had made it to her office I had already eaten 3! They are awesome! And the nutrition facts impressed me as well, not as unhealthy as I was thinking they would be.\nMy coworker loved them as well and as a matter of fact she is joining Swaggable as I write this review. :)",
  "Oh my gosh, YES!!!!! These are an absolute, MUST-NOT-SHARE must-have!!!! I FREAKIN&#39; LOVE THESE!!! I love the crunch brownie corners....but now I don&#39;t even have to make a batch in order to enjoy them!!! Because they come in this bag!!!! I LOVE THESE!!! Thank you, Sheila G for creating them!!!\n",
  "I am so glad that when I got this sample they sent me two bags.  My kids (and my grandma) finished off the first bag before I even got a chance to try one!  Today I opened the other bag.  I had visions of peanut butter brittle type hardness and worried that maybe it would be too hard.  Oh but it wasn&#39;t.  It was perfect.  Crunchy like a chip but chocolate like a brownie.  It was perfect.  I adore them. I want more!  Glad they included a coupon!\n",
  "Brownie brittle was so good! It tastes likes always eating the corner crunchy brownie.",
  "These are sooo good the person that made these must have known that I crave the crunchy parts of a brownie.  I think they are perfect for a sweet tooth snack then when they are gone and there are only crumbs left    use the crumbs on ice cream  sooooo yummy   I want to try all flavors  the chocalate chip kind is to die for.  \n",
  "All i can say about this things is that i love them!!!!! i don&#39;t think they taste so much like brownies..... i think they taste more like a thin chocolate chocolate chip cookie, eithery way i like it and they are deliseous and i highly recomend you go grab a few bags!!!\n",
  "I received my Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle in the mail yesterday. I was very excited to try it! My husband and I tried some as soon as we opened the box. It was very enjoyable. Later that night I got a glass of milk and started dunking the brittle in my milk...it was fantastic!!! Eating them with milk made them even better than eating them alone!  We shared some with friends and encouraged them to buy some too! I definitely recommend this product, it will cure any sweet tooth!  The fact that it only has 120 calories/ounce is just icing on the cake! Will be purchasing more of this for sure!!\n",
  "Tried the brownie brittle and omg this stuff is addicting its like the flavor of a brownie but the texture of a cookie or graham cracker. I couldnt stop eating them. I would def recommend trying these out if you havent.  ",
  "When I recieved my samples of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle, I was a little hesitant about trying it. After all, if I wanted to I could just go eat actual brownies instead of this chip looking ones. HOWEVER, I convinced myself to keep an open mind and boy I am glad that I did!!! I opened up a bag and it was gone soon after! I didn&#39;t even want to share with my husband, but finally I let him lol :) \n\nIt was crunchy and the chocolate flavor wasn&#39;t overpowering. It&#39;s really amazing that it is only 120 calories per ounce! It tastes amazing and it&#39;s pretty healthy to eat! Awesome product, I encourage everyone to try it! I can&#39;t wait to buy more! \n",
  "well. mine came and were all broken into a million pieces, but other than that the product was good! I got the chocolate chip variety, it was very good. I think that I would like to try the mint option too! This stuff tastes just like the crunchy edges that everyone fights for at my house! They are pretty healthy and a good treat when you need a little something sweet without wrecking your whole diet plan. I will for sure buy these when I see them out!\n",
  "LOVE EM\n\nSHELIA G&#39;S BROWNIE BRITTLE GET 8 THUMBS UP! As much as I wanted to keep these to myself I shared them with my family, and I&#39;m jealous because they actually compared them to my homemade brownies.  I have to agree they taste just like they are out the oven.  With them only being 120 calories I did not fill guilty indulging.\n",
  "I loved them so much. they were wonderful to snack on as a portable dessert. crisp and chocolately perfect for a chocolate craving! thanks so much! here is my you tube review! Thanks!!  http://youtu.be/_83wolP9A6A\n",
  "Crispy brownie pieces with yummy chocolate chips! Nothing better! Except that theyre weight watchers approved! I would definitely purchase this product!",
  "HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT BROWNIE BRITTLE BEFORE!?!?!?\n\n \n\nSERIOUSLY!! \n\nAt first I was expecting a chocolate version of peanut brittle. I dont like peanut brittle (its too sickly sweet for me) so i was kinda wary about trying this. Once i got my package i read the back and was surprised to learn a little about Sheila G and the concept of making something thats just like the corners and cripsy parts of brownies. I opened it up and found some decent sized squares with chocolate chips in them. Then i tried one... and o. m. ggggggggggggggggoooodness they are SO good!! Its like the worlds best chocolate chip cookie EVER. If you have ever gotten the double chocolate chip cookie from Subway (one of my all time favorites), it tastes like that, but with a super crisp crunch! I cant begin to explain how often i am going to start buying these. I could sit here all day and rave about how tasty they are, but it really wont do any good until you get off your tush and get a bag! I promise it wont disappoint! I dont give many products a 5 star rating but this product is well worth every star. These are a healthier alternative to sweets, come in different flavors (the bag doesnt list the other flavors available), and are supported by WeightWatchers.com!\n\n \n\nQUIT READING AND GET A BAG!!! :)\n",
  "These are super tasty! I love the crunchiness with a brownie flavor! I wouldn&#39;t necessarily compare them to the edges of a brownie, since those tend to be chewier than crunchy, but they&#39;re still awesome!\n",
  "This product is a very crispy chocolate chocolate chip cookie. It is described on the bag as the crispy part of a brownie, but it really reminds me more of a well done cookie. The pieces are not uniform in size, so you can reach in the bag and retrieve a small piece or one as large as your hand. But each piece is very crispy and the flavor is fantastic. It is difficult to stop eating these. We bought one bag and it was gone in a day, which led me to look on Amazon to see if I could buy more of it and have it conveniently delivered, hopefully in bulk supply, to my home. Just back the truck up to my garage and unload the boxes ... that would be fine with me. So, if you contemplate ordering this product, do not buy just one bag. You will be sorry. Instead, buy many bags, keep your family happy, and enjoy one of the best snacks ever invented.\n",
  "First of all, thanks swaggable for sending me this product. Not one, i got two packets of choclate chip Brownie Brittle. I recieved the bags yesterday, but opened today. They were choclaty, square shaped and crunchy. Taste is awesome. My 3 years old daughter went crazy for these brownie brittle. I would definetly recommend this products to others especially people with kids. Taste is really very good. I will definetly purchase this product in future.\n",
  "I tried the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. It is amazing! You will fall in love with it! I have seen this product in stores before but never tried it. I will be buying it now! My family also loved it. It was crunchy like a cookie but tasted just like a chocolate chip Brownie. We look forward to trying more flavors!\n",
  "I received my Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle today, and this stuff is awesome! It&#39;s a novel idea, very unique. My kids loved it too. The only downfall is  the price. I visited the website, and it&#39;s very expensive!! But overall a great and delicious product.\n",
  "Delicious! I wasnt sure about them when I looked at the package, but Im glad i tried them! The package doesnt lie, its like a corner piece every time! ",
  "This product was really good. awesome snack. I cant wait to try other flavors with my coupon. thank you!",
  "OMG!! The brownie brittle chocolate chip flavored treats are delicious they are kosher and made with natural ingredients. Literally addicting, I tried to have a few and I ended up devoyring down the whole bag in 30 seconds. Thy are Krispy,  crunchy ,  sweet and they only have 14 g of sugar, 120 cal, 4 g of fat total, 1 g saturated fat and 95 mg of sodium with 21g carbohydrates per 1 ounce serving.  While I enjoy them thoroughly I do believe I could get in trouble with my body LOL if I had my way to eat as many as I wanted.  These do contain wheat, eggs, soy and milk so if youre not sensitive to those ingredients give them a try, these also come and other flavors besides the chocolate chip such as toffee crunch, salted caramel and mint chocolate chip.  I always liked the crispy edges of the brownie,mnow thanks to Sheila G I get my crispy edges :) I think these would be a great snack for after dinner or for movie time I dont necessarily know if I would classify it as an any time snack though. But they are super delicious and I definitely will be buying more if I can find them in my local grocery store.",
  "omg these are the best. I am a huge brownies fan and all I need is a few chips and I am satisfied.It doesnt taste like a diet snack but really it is because it is so satisfying which so little. \n",
  "I was so excited when I got my box from #swaggable that had a full size bag of Sheila Gs Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. I was cooking dinner so I sat it to the side and finished up...forgot about the bag until today. I was working hard on school work and needed some type of snack to get me through the next chapter. The bag was sitting there calling my name so I mean I had to give it a try. I open the bag at my desk and pull out the first bite. I check it out to see whats really going on. It looks like a chocolate potato chip so I take my first bite. Its like biting into awesomeness that words cannot describe. Its chocolate with a crunch and pretty much perfection! I will have to find somewhere to buy this because once this bag is empty, its gonna get ugly in our house! You must try this product, you cannot go wrong and if you dont like it, something is def wrong. Love, love, love!!! ",
  "OMG I have found my new go to vice!  These are dangerously delicious!  I received my Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle and tried them and could not stop eating them!  My kids wanted to try and I said NO!  These are mommy&#39;s!  I did give them a taste though and they loved them as well.  Tastes like a home made chocolate chip cookie and the corner of the brownie pan.  I have died and gone to heaven.  I will be searching these out to get more!\n",
  "My full size bag of Brownie Brittle arrived today, and it was such a great surprise. I had almost forgotton that it was arriving, and my fiance and I were quite excited to break it open and try it out!\n\nThe brittle comes in a resealable bag and is filled with a variety of diffferent broken shaped pieces of brownie brittle. Each piece has chocolate chips baked onto it. These little brittle pieces are packed with a delicious chocolate flavor and a very satisfying crispy crunch.\n\nMy fiance and I both loved the flavor, and both agree it goes very well with coffee, or as a light dessert. I am absolutely going to pick up another bag of this brittle!\n",
  "We loved the Brownie Brittle! It was really good. The taste is just like the crispy edges of brownies and it even has chocolate chips mixed in. It is really good crushed up & mixed in vanilla ice cream with some more sprinkled on top! I can&#39;t wait to get some more.\n",
  "I received my Sheilas Gs Brownie Brittle last night and got to try this morning together with my 2 kids. It was so,so good.I love anything with chocolates but I tried to avoid those too sweet ,but this brownie brittle has the perfect sweetness and crunch with a generous amount of whole chocolate. My 2 kids also enjoyed this,they even ate more than me. I also loved that it has fewer calories compared to other chocolate brownies or cookies. Plus it is peanut free so my kids can bring it to school for their snacks and not worry about the peanut free policy.",
  "This stuff is GREAT! Love it, love it, love it! It is super good. I love the crunchy parts of the brownie and now I don&#39;t even have to be scraping the sides of the pan for it. Super chocolate yumminess!\n",
  "i was THIRLLED to get this Brownie Brittle in the mail.   At a church gathering this summer someone had put out 2 bags of the chocolate chip flavor on the snack table.   when i got there the bags were EMPTY :(   everyone was saying how delicious it is.      mine came yesterday and both bags are EMPTY :)    my kids and i love it!!  it is thin and crispy and PERFECT for dipping in milk, which my kids did.   i love that it is the best part of the brownie, and doesn&#39;t make you feel guilty after eating it, like regular brownies would.    i would recommend this to anyone wanting a unique chocolatey snack that is fun to eat.   i will definitely buy this.  a friend just told me where i can find it and i&#39;m going there tomorrow!\n",
  "love it great taste and flavor would defenetly tell my friends all about this and buy more\n",
  "What a great way to be able to bring brownies on the go!! This tasted so delicious. Such great flavor. It gives you that crunch that satisfies and the flavor was amazing!! The pieces are not all the same size, so if you are just looking for something to satisfy your craving, you can get that in a small or large piece. It was difficult for us to stop eating them. We will definitely be buying more and recommending them to friends! \n",
  "Sheila Gs chocolate chip brownie brittle was awesome!!! Everyone in my family loved these especially my little girls. They taste so good and I love that they are crunchy!!",
  "Loved the taste! I would definetly buy this in a store! I want to try the other flavors out too!\n",
  "I was very impressed with the brownie brittle. I assumed before trying them that they would be hard but not at all! My 2 year old and I both love these\n",
  "I was pleasantly surprised when I received this in the mail. I had completely forgotten that I had wanted this! The sample size was also surprising. It was a full sized bag!! My family and I LOVE this. It was quite tasty, it doesn&#39;t have that weird aftertaste that a lot of bagged chocolate goodies have, and it was crispy without being overbearingly so! I definitely plan on buying this product and recommend it highly. \n",
  "Was very yummy and was surprisingly satisfying in small portions. Low in calories too- I&#39;m buying this again for sure!\n",
  "I enjoyed this product more than I thought I would. To me, brownies are normally rich and not something you can eat a lot of. These were light and crispy. I could eat them like I would chips and with only 120 calories, I could do so without feeling guilty. I would reccomend these to my friends and look foward to trying the other varieties.\n",
  "I just got these in the mail today and I expected the sample to be much small, they were 2 pretty decent size bags. they are SOOOO delicious!!! I cant wait to buy these again!!!",
  "These are absolely amazing.  It&#39;s a brownie cookie.  They are very addictive.  I was so upset when my pack was empty.  I like the sample packs though because if I had the full sizer bag I don&#39;t know if could stop from going overboard.  LOL.  Pick these up for sure and give them a try, you won&#39;t regret it at all.\n",
  "I definately recommend Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle!! I love the crunchy, sweet, chocolatey flavor! Very scrumptious!! Perfect for a quick snack! =D \n",
  "Didn&#39;t know what this sample would consist of and was pleasantly surprised by the big bag sent to me to try out. Brownie Brittle is a thin, crisp, yummy to my tummy sweet treat. They taste like the outside corners and edges of a homemade brownie. I am in love and so are my boys! Already went to the store and purchased more. Great low calorie/fat intake also to solve my late night cravings without feeling guilty. Two thumbs up!!\n",
  "I am not one that loves the edges of brownies...  I prefer the inside pieces but these were DELICIOUS!  :)  Even my 1 year old loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle!  I can&#39;t wait to get some more!\n",
  "I absolutely love these!  They are way better than a cookie and do remind me of the corner bites of a brownie.   They have a great chocolate flavor and very crunchy.   I would reach for these every time I was looking for a sweet snack.   Who needs to go and make brownies when you can have this wonderful chrunchy goodness right in a bag!   I strongly recommend them and would buy them often.  I can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors!\n",
  "Ive never tried brittle before let alone from the making of a brownie. Overall the taste was amazing, but I have only one complaint ... it leaves a cotton mouth taste after you eat them. But I would recommend a big glass of milk.",
  "I just received my sample (a full size sample - thank you Swaggable!) of the Shiela G Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle and I have to say I think I just died and went to heaven!  Seriously.  These Brownie Brittle and so delicious.  The minute I opend the bag I could smell the home made brownie smell, it was intoxicating.  I thought, well maybe it just smells good but won&#39;t taste that great. I am so glad I was wrong.  These brownie brittle are like crispy, crunchy, crumbly cookies but with the taste of home made brownies.  The chocolate chips just add ten times more flavor and a nice creamy texture to contrast the crispiness.  My husband was skeptical to try them out but once I gave him a smell he had to see for himself and he honestly really enjoyed them.  Even my daughter who is probably one of the most picky eaters out there tried it out and liked it.  What I really liked (aside from the amazing flavor!) was the nutritional stats.  The calories and fat are on the lower side (for a dessert) and while the sugar is on the higher side this snack could easily curb a choco craving without breaking your diet.  I will definitely purchase these to have at home.  Try them, you will not regret it....though your waist line might ;)  \n",
  "i have to say i fell in love with the brownie brittle i love how thin it is and the diff size pieces in the bag i would def buy this again and again 5 stars keep making them \n",
  "I am going to have to say that i LOVED this product!  Oh my gosh!  Whoever decided to put the burnt edge taste of a brownie into this item was GENIUS!!  The flavor is perfect.  It taste exactly like a brownie but crispy.  I was actually very surprised on the calories.  That is always the first place i look since i try to watch my intake.  Before i even opened the package and saw that it was 120 calories for one ounce, i thought it certainly couldn&#39;t taste that good.  But i was surprised!  great flavor, reasonably low calories for such a tasty chocolate treat and the package says it is made with natural ingrediants.  I tried to hide the package in my room so my husband and youngest daughter wouldn&#39;t get it, but they both managed to steal some bits of chocolatey goodness.  This is a highly recommend.  Now if I can just find it in my local stores i will be in heaven!\n",
  "The Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle was definitely a tasty treat that the kids really enjoyed! If you are a chocolate fan, than this is the snack for you! :)\n",
  "This Brownie Brittle is AMAZING! This is so good and so addictive. This bag of brittle did not last long. It tasted like a brownie and has such a nice crunch to it. I would suggest this to everyone!!!!! Trust me buy this stuff.\n",
  "These Chocolate Chip Brownie taste  Great ..fantastic! They taste like a brownie flavored cookie but shape like Chips! There are pieces in the bag that are big and small and 1 oz is 100 calories. great for last night snack. \n",
  "This Brownie Brittle is awesome.....tastes great !!  I had to hide it from my 12 yr old son so I could enjoy it too!\n",
  "CHocolate Chip Brownie taste fantastic! They taste like a brownie flavored cookie! There are pieces in the bag that are big and small and 1 oz is 100 calories. It definitely satisfies that sweets.\n",
  "I was really excited to get this in the mail and very pleased at the result. They are deliciously chocolatey and rich without being too cloyingly sweet. However, they remind me of a gourmet version of &#39;cookie crisp&#39; cereal. Is that a bad thing? That&#39;s totally up to the taster. My roommates adore how they mimic the best part of a brownie, the crispy edges. It&#39;s been a hit with everyone in my household. I think I&#39;d buy it as a crispy chocolatey cracker-cookie, but I don&#39;t like thinking of it as brownie related...I guess because MY favorite part of a brownie is the soft, fudgey/cakey moist part. I&#39;ve never understood the edge thing! Oh well. This is an excellent product for what it was meant to be, and I appreciate it for that. \n",
  "I just sampled Sheli G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle and it is really good,  I wish I was able to sample all the flavors.  These were a big hit in the office. I tried them and about 7 coworkers tried them and we all loved it.  They are light, crispy and have a great chocolate flavor.  Once you start eating them you won&#39;t want to stop. They are a great snack to beat the chocolate craving and one serving is 120  calories.  The only thing I didn&#39;t like was the price but hopefully I can find them on sale or a good deal somewhere.\n",
  "I saw the brownie brittle at Costco and had been wanting to try it. As luck would have it Swaggable offered to send me some to sample. I may or may not have eaten the whole back in one sitting. The chocolate taste was yummy and the texture was interesting.\n",
  "Absolutely delicious. Wonderful brittle. Loved it.  Even my two year old couldn&#39;t get enough of this prodcut. Will definitely buy more of this product.\n",
  "I was really not expecting to like this product as much as I did!  I am not a crunchy corner brownie lover!  I have always loved the soft middle pieces with no edge!  Even so, I think this crunchy Brownie Brittle is delicious!  I love that there are little chocolate chips as well as the crunchy part.  After I started to really enjoy this yummy treat I began to worry about the loads of calories I was pobably injesting.  To my happy surprise each serving is only 120 calories!  This is definitely a product I would buy at the store.  Brownie Brittle is a tasty sweet treat!\n",
  "Holy moly! This are amazing. They taste just like brownies, but have that super crunch. My daughter loves them, the whole family loves them. I would buy bags of these for fun!\n",
  "OMG AMAGING! I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect but I never expecting them to be half as good as they are! I love the chovolate chips in them. They are made with all natural ingredients and out of this world. I will most deffentily be buying this product. \n",
  "Omg ok. *breathes* These are so incredibly scrumptious. They are just like the name describes, the crispy ends of the brownies. I love that she came up with these, because it really keeps me from baking up a whole batch and eating the thing on my own. It has been done on a few occasions :/ They are on the expensive side but sales people! look for them and then look for coupons. Thank you for the added 50 cents off coupon AND for sending a FULL size bag to try. Wonderful product and healthier than avg batch of brownies. I love these so much I pitched the company to review all  their flavors on my blog! I will be repurchasing in definitely! \n",
  "This stuff is really good.  Im trying to eat healthy right now so its a bit too much sugar for me.  Other then that its great.\n",
  "I had never heard of any kind of snack like this but was excited to try it when it arrived. I absolutely loved this snack. It was the perfect amount of crispiness, and the cocoa flavor was delicious. I don&#39;t usually crave brownies but this was delicous. I would definitely buy this in the future and also would recommend other people to buy it. I can see myself buying this for when people come over to have on the counter in a bowl. \n",
  "I was expecting something hard because that&#39;s what you expect with brittle. These were just the perfect kind of crunchy. They tasted great. My husband and my kids helped me eat them and the kids were pretty disappointed when I showed them the empty bag. These were definitely not what I expected but I would buy them if I can find them in my local store and I would love to try the other flavors\n",
  "These Brownie Brittle are very tasty especially if you need a chocolate fix. They were nice and crispy just like the ends of the browie which makes them even better. I can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors I know they are good as well. I even shared with my mother-in-law and she enjoyed them as well, so these are a keeper.\n",
  "Seriously this stuff is amazing! It&#39;s like eatting those crispy edges of the brownie all in a bag. the right amount of chocolate. I couldn&#39;t stop. I ate the whole bag before I knew it. I will definitely be buying more. Amazing sample! \n",
  "I recieved the chocalate chip brownie brittle by Sheila G&#39;s yesterday and my family and I love these!thanks so much for allowing me to try this product.i will deffinately buy some and will spread the word! VERY TASTY!!! thanks again\n",
  "I got 2 boxes of these in the mail some how. I love them! I have them last night with some milk, they were delicious. I&#39;m going to buy this for my mom for christmas. So yummy\n",
  "I received Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle yesterday and the whole family loved them! Everyone loves how crunchy they are, and we all think the chocolate chips are a really nice addition. Once the bag ran out I had an idea to try making some of my own, and decided to make blondie brittle. I just spread the mixture on a sheet pan really thin and bake until brown. They were perfect. I loved this product and hope to see it in stores, I will be looking for them for sure.\n",
  "I love the brownie brittle. I am a huge fan of brownies, so I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to like this since it&#39;s crunchy and not soft like regular brownies. I think it taste great and is a lot easier to deal with than having to make a pan of brownies. I would definitely buy this!\n",
  "Omg these are so yummy there like a cracker but they taste like brownie they are really lite so I know I could eat the whole bag.  Im addicted my whole family is. I will be getting more if I could find them.",
  "This brownie brittle was AMAZING. So good! So unique. So craveable! I couldn&#39;t get enough. I almost didn&#39;t want to share with the family. I suggest that if you do buy this that you buy a couple of bags. Its that good. I recommend for all age groups and can travel really well. I will definitely be buying more!\n",
  "At first I wasnt sure how I would feel about these, but if you are looking for a chocolate crunch, these are great. Not really a brownie but not a cookie either.\n\nIts a nice thin crisp of chocolate goodness.\n\nI like this and would share these with friends.",
  "I&#39;ve seen this product for the last year or so at Costco and once during the holidays, I picked up the bag but my uncertainty made me put it down on my maybe next time list.  It&#39;s a big bag at Costco and because I could not see the product, I was worried about getting a lot of dust versus pieces of actual brittle.  Then Swaggable offered me the opportunity to try the product out so it&#39;s like I was caught on camera carrying the bag and then changing my mind......spooky!  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nUpon opening the first bag, you get an intense chocolate smell.  It just starts to hypnotize you and worse, those that may be standing near you too.  So, when you purchase a bag, I warn you to open it in an empty room if you are not the sharing type.  I looked inside and was amazed to see the brittle shaped into squares.  This brittle tends to not break into shards and the usual uneven pieces that turn into powder or even poke bags open.  These squares are a perfect snack size and most were in perfect shape.  They almost resemble thin cookies.....the wafer kind.  I notice there is a healthy amount of chocolate chips, so I have not been cheated, in case you were worried.  I notice you get little crumbles so very much like you would imagine a very thin chocolate chip cookie to be like.  Smells like brownies, so I take a bite.  The product is just like the company advertises, it tastes like the edge of a brownie square....you know what comes it contact with the pan and crisps up from the butters and oils released by the chocolate and cocoa.  Just think of someone baking brownies and shaving off the crispy edges but being kind enough to keep it looking (square) pretty. You get that airiness and it is a light crisp with an intense chocolate flavor.  I liked it and finished off my square and went throughout my day.\n\n \n\nThe Taste Test:\n\nThe next morning I wake up and I am making my breakfast bowl of pumpkin granola clusters, almonds, accompanied by Almond milk and I spot the taped up bag of the brownie brittle.  I open it and take 2 squares out and crumble them on top and I start to move on over to my lap top while taking a bite.  Oh my.....it made my breakfast sinfully delicious.  I started to think of brownie brittle over yogurt and then brownie brittle with ice cream and even baking a cheesecake with a brownie brittle bottom......let&#39;s say I got carried away.  It seems my appreciation of the brownie brittle square alone was under valued on Monday until I paired it up with other stuff and it seriously shined!!!  I saw the literature they enclosed and they have other flavors like:\n\n \n\n\n\tToffee Crunch (so curious as I LOVE toffee)\n\tSalted Caramel (must try!)\n\tMint Chocolate Chip \n\tand of course, The Chocolate chip one I tried\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle is 120 calories for one ounce and it will satisfy a chocolate craving in less than that.Things to note is the product does contain corn syrup solids and I understand it is sometimes needed to achieve the desired texture.  You do see sugar and cocoa and my only dislike in the list of ingredients was the caramel coloring.  I am not a fan of dyes and prefer a less fantastic color if the taste and texture are there but other than that, this brittle has less going on than your common candy bar and more chocolate satisfaction!\n\n \n\nCheck them out on-line at:\n\n \n\nWebsite http://browniebrittle.com/\n\nStore Locator http://browniebrittle.com/find-a-store/\n\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/BrownieBrittle\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/BrownieBrittle\n\nPinterest http://www.pinterest.com/browniebrittle/\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI received the above product from Swaggable and Sheila G&#39;s, free of charge.  I am not obligated in providing positive/favorable feedback, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the brand and/or it&#39;s products, which may differ from yours. \n",
  "AMAZING!!! I loved this product 100% percent. The flavor, the taste, the crunch. Perfect! I give this product a 10 out of 10 review.\n",
  "I reviewed the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle for honest review from Swaggable. I received the Brownie Brittle in the mail yesterday. \n\nInstead of eating a whole brownie, you get this crisp, which has the full flavor of a brownie. There was chocolate chips in each brittle. Some had more, some had less. Since it is a brittle, there were large and small pieces in the bag. \n\nI loved the brownie Brittle. My family loved it as well. I don&#39;t have much of it left. I had to hide the bag from my two year old because he was trying to dump out the contents on my bed. This is a great way to snack without eating a big thick brownie lol. \n",
  "A bag of corner brownie pieces all for me??  YUM...this was a little piece of heaven and there was even enough for me to share with my kids!  It tastes exactly like a brownie, but with the crunchiness/crispiness of a cookie.  These are the perfect treat when I&#39;m craving something sweet, but don&#39;t want to load up on a bunch of empty calories. \n",
  "My whole family loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle from Sheila G&#39;s. It was crunchy and delicious. I didn&#39;t feel guilty eating this product because it was only 120 calories per serving. Great taste of chocolate without being overly sweet. I would suggest anyone to try this product at least once. Thank you.\n",
  "Love the chocolate flavor in brittle. An interesting new concept. Was a nice bag for sampling. Shared it with family they loved it too. Thanks for letting us try it out!!!\n",
  "I was shocked to get two full 4 oz. sample bags to try out.  After tasting them, they sort of taste like chocolate crackers.  They are VERY crispy and thin.  I think if they had been thicker, they would have tasted a little better.  I&#39;m one for the chewy part of brownies and hate the sides...so that&#39;s why I gave the review 3 stars overall. \n",
  "Loved it. Great taste. Nice size sample. Shared it with fam they all loved it too. Thanks for the sample\n",
  "I got my two samples today !! Very tasty treat indeed and a good size bag.\n\nI can see why it&#39;s a hot item for Weightwatchers because it really is delicious and doesn&#39;t seem too bad for your hips. I need to look up where to buy it !! My 3 year old son got in on the bag and really enjoyed it as well.\n\nI gave it a 4 out of 5 because really is a delicious treat but I&#39;m the chewy brownie type girl so I can&#39;t do 5, sorry.\n\n \n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is a great sweet snack for on the go or for an at home munchie. Tastes exactly like a delicious brownie with way less calories! Perfect for all of those watching their calories and those just looking for portable brownies! I will definitely be keeping these on hand!\n",
  "The rich chocolate flavor and the nice thin wafer like crunch was a hit in my house. The chocolate was \n\nrich like a milk chocolate and the brittle part tasted just like the brittle I remember but full out chocolate. This is a great late night with coffee snack(at least i thought so). And with only a 120 calories how can you resist.\n",
  "I loved this!!! It tasted sooo good. I will definitely buy this even my husband liked it and he doesnt like brownies. People really needs to try this. I got it on Monday and by Tuesday it was gone.",
  "This was a delicious snack, like eating a brownie flavored chocolate chip cookie.  They were so yummy that I had to put the bag away where it was hard to reach to keep myself from eating the whole thing right away.And I love that they come in different flavors.  I will definitely buy this in the future and recommend that anyone who likes the crispy edges of brownies buy it too.\n",
  "i love this stuff. judging from the bag i idnt think it was going to be good but, it was the best thing ever. my new favorite snack!!!!! where can i buy this?\n",
  "Soo delicious! I will definitely be buying these! Thank you :)",
  "This was Very yummy. It taste just like a brownie. Try it on ice cream It it amazing. My whole family love&#39;s it and wants to know where to buy it. Only problem is you want more... \n\n \n",
  "These are amazing! They taste just like yummy brownies but in a brittle form, which is fun and light. They are a nice little snack to quench your brownie craving! ",
  "I was nervous to try this one...but after seeing the calorie count and smelling the aroma of brownies, I had to try. They were a lighter version of a brownie chip! These were amazing and a perfect desert for someone watching calories. Loved this one!\n",
  "The Sheila G Brownie chocalate chip  brittle was a amazing! My family ate the whole bag up in minutes! The taste was great not too sweet. The texture was easy to the mouth. I wouuld definitely recommend this snack to all my friends to try because the look looks off & burnt but their nice and crunchy and not to sweet for us not too sweet people. Every go out & buy these they will not disappoint.\n",
  "Oh my god this stuff was the best snack I have ever tried. It was light, crunchy, and melted in my mouth. I had to hide them at work because people kept trying to steal a bite. I really look forward to trying the other kinds now as well.\n\nP.S. Make a blonde version?\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is  so yummy.. It&#39;s fun to eat because it&#39;s crispy and delicious... \n",
  "This was yummy! Think of a brownie in a cookie form and you have the best of both worlds in this brownie brittle! Loved it!",
  "Oh my gosh I forgot about these coming to sample so was surprised when I opened the package. Our whole family tryed them and ALL loved it. It definately tasted like the crispy edges of a brownie. I love crispy crunchy food so this was awesome! It is only 120 calories/ounce so you don&#39;t have to feel guilty eating these. I highly recommend. =)\n",
  "Brownie Brittle is even better than it sounds! Think toasted edges of the best brownie ever and you have brownie brittle. It was crispy without being overly messy, sweet, but not too sweet, with yummy little chocolate chips. The whole bag disappeared in about 5 minutes! Even the crumbs were devoured. I will be looking for this product next time I go to the store. It&#39;s a great sweet treat for my kids.\n",
  "The Brownie Brittle is very good. Definitely a brownie/chocolate chip cookie taste. Not really sure why it&#39;s called brittle. I was thinking of something like peanut brittle etc.. but this is more like a flat crunchy cookie. These are perfect for people like me that don&#39;t eat a lot of sweets. You can have a piece and the rest saves perfectly for later.\n",
  "I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when I first got Sheila.G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle, I was pleasantly surprised, they have good flavor, they aren&#39;t real heavy to snack on and the kids loved them-although they compared it to a burnt chocolate chip cookie but in a good way.\n",
  "Seriously...This stuff it awesome!!! Tastes just like a crunchy brownie melting in your mouth. My hubby and I went out the next day and used the coupon we got on a Bag of the Holiday Treat brownie brittle. Fantastic Product!\n",
  "I loved these and so did my husband and really dont eat much sweets but he enjoyed these I do plan I buying these!!",
  "Thank you swaggable for introducing me to this amazing snack! Sheila G&#39;s chocolate chip brownie brittle is a healthy, delicious snack that is very addictive! My family and I loved this snack! If your a chocolate lover you will love this snack.\n",
  "WOW!! These things are amazing! Sheila G had a great idea and executed it perfectly!! The Brownie brittle is crunchy but not hard and has amazing flavor!! My hunny and I ate a bag as soon as we received it and now we are HOOKED!!\n\nI would defiantly recommend this to anyone who LOVES the brownie corner pieces! \n",
  "i really enyoi the flavor, the crispinest and everything about it! i LOVE chocolate chips!\n",
  "I loved the brownie bites. They were fun and tasted very good . My son enjoyed them as well . I am so glad I found these brownies i will be looking for them at my local store. \n",
  "I recently received two small bags of Brownie Brittle, so I gave one to my husband, and kept one for myself to sample. I figured that two reviews are better than one! We both decided that it sounded like something that would be a nice snack to have along with our after-dinner coffee. \n\nUpon opening the bag, the aroma of rich chocolate emerges. There are all different sizes and pieces of brittle inside. I wouldn&#39;t call these pieces brittle, literally. You can easily break them like a cookie or a cracker. They have an extremely light consistency. They also have little chocolate chips baked onto them!\n\nMy husband and I both agree that these are some of the most delicious things we have ever eaten! They were light and crunchy, but less like a cookie. They definitely have a crisp to them. The chocolate flavor is so rich and real. No fake chocolate flavor on these! I think they are perfect to put on a plate during coffee with friends and my husband thinks they would be great to stick into a bowl of ice cream as a yummy garnish. I think there are lots of ways you could use these in your daily life, but I think they do just fine as a whenever you get a chocolate craving snack! Definitely picking these up again with the coupon I received. Thank you!\n",
  "These were OK. I like brownies... but I like the chewy part lol. The taste however was really good. I would have liked them to be just a tad thicker. Felt like I was eating a chocolate flavored cracker. \n",
  "Love the crispy crunchy edges of a rich gourmet brownie? Then you owe it to yourself to try Award-Winning Brownie Brittle™ snacks by Sheila G. Named as a hot item by WeightWatchers.com® (only 120 calories/ounce), Brownie Brittle snacks are peanut-free, certified-Kosher, m\n",
  "These are great! My kids ate them as an after school treat one day and they loved them! They taste like homemade brownies, not packaged. They have a really nice flavor and texture and are fun to eat. I definitely peer eating these over an actual brownie. I enjoy the crunch you get with these and the chip-like shape and crunch is great! I would definitely purchase these again in the future. ",
  "The day I recieved this in the mail the package was almost gone. My daughter almost ate the package. I really enjoy the taste also.I will buy this in the store. I love that I got a full bag of brownies and a $.50 coupon to get more. I wish all the samples were like this.\n",
  "Omgsh these chocolate chip brittle are amazing for those who are chocolate lovers. Im in love with my bag,",
  "This product tasted nice and delicious.\n\nI enjoyed it very much.\n\nI love brownies, and this was a lower fat twist on them!.\n\nDelicious!\n",
  " With 6 pieces of this stuff only being 120 calories, where do you go wrong?! I felt good eating it and letting my son eat it knowing that it was not entirely junk food. My hubs is also concerned about his weight a little bit and so this gave him an indulgence without having to worry that he was going to wake up feeling like he just ruined his diet. This product is Weight Watchers endorsed which is awesome! I think it&#39;s funny that the part of chewy brownies that people normally discard as crust became a major seller and yummy and good for you treat that Sheila G just put into action.\n",
  "These were deliciously chocolatey. They have a nice crunch. I would definitely rebuy. ",
  "These brownie brittle bites were delicious! My 3 minis devoured a bag in a couple minutes. I sampled the chocolate chip and every bite had a chocolate chip in it. Theyre sweet, chocolatey and crispy. Yum! ",
  "These brownie brittle are so good! Its like the crispy edges of brownies, but in a thin crisp and with chocolate chips in it! Great with a glass of milk ;) Only 120 callories per serving [240 per bag] so it feels like a guilty pleasure, but you dont have to have the guilt!! And they have a great chocolaty flavor, no &#39;good for you&#39; taste at all. Just good! Definitly would buy these!\n",
  "These may be my new go to choclate snack! Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is DELISCIOUS. It tastes like the best part of the brownie in every bite! They are very rich, so only a couple satisfies your choclate cravings and the nutritional stats are very reasonable! \n",
  "Loved these, sweet, crunchy delicious different kind of snack\n",
  "I absolutely loved this! It tasted just like the corners of my brownies, they are low in fat and they use natural ingredients which I love! How can you beat that! Delicious! Ill definitely be buying these soon! I let all my friends sample with me! Best chocolate snack ever! Recommending these to everyone I know!",
  "Brownie Brittle is AMAZING!  It&#39;s so full of flavor and the whole bag is full of everyones favorite crispy part of the brownie!  I hope I can find some in my area so I can buy more!  FANTASTIC!\n",
  "At first when I heard the name Brownie Brittle, I was nervous that it was going to be more like peanut brittle. Ive never been a huge fan of peanut brittle...I was really happy when I opened the bag and saw that this product was very different! It had a similar shape but entirely different texture and taste.\n\nSheila Gs Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle pieces are thin, crispy, light, and delicious. They are chocolate flavored with chocolate chips in them, but they are not overly chocolately and not too sweet. They are perfect. They have a kind of cookie/cracker-like texture,which my family and I love. Everyone in my family tried it and really liked it. \n\nI do recommend it to people who love the taste of brownies but want something a bit lighter. Brownie Brittle is a great snack option. Its not as high in fat as many other chocolate treats, but still have a great flavor. They also come in a few other flavors if youre not a huge fan of chocolate.\n\nWill I be purchasing any Brownie Brittle in the future? Most definitely! Thank you swaggable and Sheila Gs for sending such a delicious sample for free!",
  "These taste exactly like a real brownie. I made brownies the day before this sample arrived and prefer the real thing. However they did send a full size bag which contains 4 servings. My husband liked them as well and was surprized at such a large portion size for only 120 calories. Since I love the soft chewy part of brownies these are not a satisfying replacement. They are worth considering as chocolate cookie/cracker. A $0.50 off coupon was included and they listed several other flavors including Toffee and Mint. I am very tempted to try the mint version since it sounds similar to thin mints.\n",
  "I just received these yesterday, and the bags almost gone! I thought this product was phenomenal, and much better than I ever expected it to be. It&#39;s crunchy and full of flavor, and just plain yummy. I think it&#39;s great for people who are weight conscience too, because you get all that rich chocolatey goodness without the guilt. I really like that the product is all natural too; that&#39;s a big plus. I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to be impressed with these as the concept seemed new and strange, but they were so yummy and rich, it was like eating a real gormet brownie; I even wanted milk! I would definately buy these if I could figure out where they sell them, and I soooooooooo recommend them to everyone who likes chocolate. I shared some with friends and they were addicted! I&#39;m gonna buy a bag and hide them next to my bed for my late night chocolate craving and so no one in my house can steal them from me.\n",
  "i just love my new brownie snack its yummy tasty and very flavorfull but i wish they were just a little thicker they are to thin for me butmy kids just love them i could nt stop them from stuffing there face good with milk coffee or just on the go \n",
  "I have to admit, when I first opened the pouch I was pretty suspect of the bronie brittle. It isn&#39;t the most appealing looking (just chucks of brown). However, once I gave a little nibble to a piece I was hooked. The flavor is just like the homemade brownies that I bake, and the crunch is perfect. I would love to get more of these. My one possible downside is that they seem as if they would crumble easily in a lunch bag, I&#39;ll have to test that out and see if they are sturdier than they look.\n",
  "Oh My!  They finally put my favorite part of the brownie in the bag.  This is genious!!!  I scarfed down the whole bag in one sitting and then wanted more. I would buy this every time I went shopping and have a stash in my drawer at work for those days I just need a comfort treat!  \n",
  "I&#39;d heard nothing but good things about Brownie Brittle and let me tell you they are all true. If you love chocolate and brownies, you&#39;ll love Brownie Brittle. I&#39;m not really a fan of crunchy brownies, so I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. I prefer my brownies to be a little more chewy than crunchy, but after trying Brownie Brittle I can say that they are definitely delicious and I will purchase these again in the future. \n",
  "My family and I got to try the chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. I have to say, I was wonderful!! They are in little squares with lots of chocolate chips. They are crispy and melt in your mouth good. My family loved them, the children were fighting over them. I can&#39;t wait to try them all. I would recommend them to moms, they are a good snack for little one&#39;s. They are thin and full of flavor.\n",
  "These are absolutely amazing!  You think it will be too hard or overly crunch but they are just perfect!  It tastes fresh made and the combination of the light crunch with the chocolate chips melting in your mouth is heaven!\n",
  "We loved the brownie brittle. It&#39;s my dream product, because I&#39;m a big fan of brownie edges. We finised the bag right away. I realized that I have this product at the Safeway, but I&#39;ve never seen it before. It doesn&#39;t sit in a good location and is not advertised well. If I would know about it, I would buy it for years already\n",
  "Taste great, However most of the product was crush powder and that many brittle pieces. \n",
  "My daughter and I LOVED this sample! I am a huge fan of egde of the pan brownies anyways, and this snack gave the right amount of crunch to satisfy my snacking need! I will be watching for this in the stores!\n",
  "This is delicious, especially if you like the corner edge of the brownie! Really delicious!\n",
  "The chocolate chip brownie brittle sample was AWESOME!! The crunchy crust of brownies really is the best part, and Sheila G&#39;s has captured that perfectly. It is so hard to believe that it&#39;s a weightwatchers ok-ed item.\n\nThe brownie brittle is full of chocolate chips. It is very chocolatey without being too rich. My only complaint is that the bag wasn&#39;t bigger. :D\n",
  "OMG i had to hide the bag to keep myself from eating it all in one sitting. My son and husband loved it too!\n",
  "What a surprise to find a mystery box with this little bag in it on my doorstep the other day!\n\nI had never heard of brownie brittle but how could anything with the word brownie in it be bad? I was thinking at first this is going to just be something ordinary and already been done but WOW was I wrong! The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was amazing – crispy, light, and crunchy with smooth chocolate chips throughout--Once I opened the bag I couldn&#39;t stop eating them. I am also a huge fan of the brownie ends and these are the cure for wanting just that! They really do give you the punch of eating a regular brownie but with half the calories and none of the full, unhealthy feeling afterwards. My co-workers were raving about them after I shared with the office – after I had a decent amount for myself first. I will definitely be looking for the other flavors at my local supermarket !\n",
  "This product is a very crispy chocolate chocolate chip cookie. It is described on the bag as the crispy part of a brownie, but it really reminds me more of a well done cookie. The pieces are not uniform in size, so you can reach in the bag and retrieve a small piece or one as large as your hand. But each piece is very crispy and the flavor is fantastic. It is difficult to stop eating these. We bought one bag and it was gone in a day. This will keep your family happy, and enjoy one of the best snacks ever invented.\n",
  "These are so delicious. They almost taste like brownie batter but they are crisp and delicious. They aren&#39;t even that bad for you. I wish I could find other flavors in my grocery store. I would buy them all. \n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is a great rich treat that tastes indulgent without going overboard on calories. I have already recommended this product to friends. The only down side to brownie brittle is that I can&#39;t find it for purchase at my local Publix. \n",
  "Overall taste was good, but I didnt liked the ingridients in these cookies. I prefer natural ingridients with no enriched added things.\n",
  "These are so amazing! There chocolatly, crunchy and perfectly sweet!! i love how when your craving somethin sweet and delicious you can have these and not feel so guilty! with only 120 calories and 4g of fat!!! having a little guilty pleasure never was good!! i recieved my bag and it was gone in minutes!!! i ahve already purchased two more bags! There a must try for everyone!!\n",
  "I was very skeptical at first about this product cause i am not one for the crunchy edges of the brownies but after giving this product a taste i love it!. the chocolate chip brownie was very chocolately and full of flavor. I didnt mind the crunch at all. Its also a plus that they arent too high in calories. I am looking forward to purchasing this product and trying other flavors.\n",
  "I tried  Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle and i loved it. Yum it was so good it tasted just like brownies right from the oven .I could eat them every day and i will buy me some more. I gave my litte girl one to try and she loved them to . So they make a good snack for little kids because they love them. I loved how they where low fat too i did not have too feel bad about eating them . They are also peanut free and all natural ingredients . I recommend these to my family and friends because i loved these. they have a very good taste go get you a bag you will love them trust me.\n",
  "Wow! I am surprised at how mouthwatering Shelia G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is.  The crunch is there, the texture is firm, the chocolate chips are chocolaty and they all come together and burst in your mouth with flavor.  I was surprised how good the Brownie Brittle is since it&#39;s only 120 calories per ounce.  It&#39;s also all natural.  I can&#39;t wait to put the coupon to use and try the different varations of Brownie Brittle Shelia G&#39;s has.  I strongly recommend this to anyone who has a sweet tooth, is health conscious, chocolate lovers, and overall brownie lovers.  \n",
  "Ate this with my boyfriendin one sitting. Not going to lie; basically the most delicious treat I&#39;ve ever had. Can&#39;t wait to buy more! \n",
  "our family loved the taste of this stuff. I love the fact that it is made with natural ingredients unlike most snacks these days. If you like chocolate you will definetly enjoy this.\n",
  "One word...YUM! These are so good! I am now a brownie brittle addict. I have purchased two bags since I recieved my trial bag from swaggable. I just cant get enough. Brownie Brittle has just the right amount of chocolate for a quick fix when I have a sweet tooth. I love the crunchiness which satisfies my urge to munch on something! I just love this stuff. It is a little pricier then I would like it to be but TOTALLY worth the extra change! Yummmy!\n",
  "I loved these, I found the bag in my mail box, opened them up to try them because I love brownies especially the crunchy corners, I did not put the bag down until they were all gone, they were delicious and to me tasted just like brownie corners. I recommend these to everyone because they are just too good.\n",
  "Oh my! These were delicious, i may need another bag to be sure! :) Very chocolatey, light and crisp at the same time. I&#39;m in love!\n",
  "I was excited to receive the sample of Sheila G.&#39;s Brownie Brittle snacks!  They are really good!  Super chocolately and crunchy with real chocolate chips in them.  They really hit the spot when you&#39;re craving something sweet! \n",
  "I loved this brownie brittle. It is a good treat for the whole family. My kids literally took the bag from me. I will be buying more. Thanks Swaggable for the sample.\n",
  "these were so delicious.they werent too hard they were just right.they tasted like a brownie but had the texture of a cookie these would have been even more awesome with some milk.i would love to try the chocolate mint the chocolate chip ones were amazing though.\n",
  "Sheila G. Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was Awsome ! If you are are the one who always eats the crispy edges when you make brownie at home. You will fall in love with Sheila G. Browinie Brittle rigth down to the crums at the bottom of the bag. Which made a great topping on your ice cream.\n",
  "After work today I went and picked up a package at my post office not having a clue what it was. Open it and was excited to see two bags of chocolate chip brownie brittle, coupon and info about the product and other flavors. Before I opened it I I had in my mind it would be hard and break off into sharp pieces. Well after opening and taking one out I realize they are light weight small squares with several chocolate chips on each snack. First impression after just one was oh these are really good. Then it was like ohhh they really do taste just like a brownie. Loved them. I couldn&#39;t stop eating them and ended up eating both bags. Yes I just admitted that. They have been my favorite thing so far to sample and I will be looking to buy them soon. Think they would go great with ice cream. Looked on the website www.browniebrittle.com and found a ton of product size options and flavors to choose from. Going to have to try the toffee crunch, salted carmel and mint chocolate chip bags. Anyone who loves brownies should sample this because I would have never thought they would be as good as they are. Yum!!!!!! Thanks Swaggable for allowing me to try before I buy.\n",
  "I felt like I had a huge brownie and it was only pieces. These are full of flavor and taste great!. Thank You \n",
  "these were very good although a little bit dry and crumbley. My 8 year old son said they were,so awesome! so i do recommend them for kids as well as adults! I was only dissappointed by the extreme crumbs! Not sure if that was from the shipping but they were very messy. Other than that they are very tasty and have great chocolate flavor! I would reccomend them to others if you are a brownie lover!\n",
  "I received the brownie brittle today and as soon as I tasted the brittle, I fell in love with it. Its fresh, crispy, enough sweetness. Thanks Swaggable for sending me the product!!\n",
  "The Brownie Brittle did not last long in our house! The one who loved it the most (besides me) was my 1 year old. I actually caught her sitting in a corner eating it! The only problem that I had was there wasn&#39;t enough!!\n",
  "This product is good i would definitely recommend this to friends and family perfect for when you get that urge for something sweet.i am going to purchase this on my next grocery trip.",
  "This is AMAZING. It is so good, but I wanted it to last so I have to limit myself when I&#39;m eating it! It is just as it is described - like the top of the brownie around the outside. Usually my favorite part of a brownie is the gooey middle, but this is so good I might change my preference of which part of the brownie I take from now on! What is also great is that it is made with natural ingredients AND Sheila G is a proud sponsor of Cookies for Kids&#39; Cancer. Highly recommend to anyone, but beware...it is addicting! Yum!\n",
  " Two words....  absolutely delicious! I love the bite size,  the crunch,  the chocolate chips. mmmmm  just so tasty and not as high in calories as youd expect.  Will definitely be buying in the other flavors too.",
  "Ill be honest and say after  tring a few bites Iam going to be greedy and NOT share my brownie brittle ! A friend said it was her crack lol , omg! she was right i love this stuff! I cant wait to try other flavors, Iam definattly recommending this to other people , Iam glad i saw it while i was grocery shopping the other day . Now i know where to find it !\n\n \n",
  "Omg i love this the taste was soo delicious I recommend this :-)",
  "Oh my goodness! Never had I tried a treat with the full status of a brownie but in a lighter, chip-like feel! With only 120 calories for the whole bag! Bravo Sheila G s!  ",
  "This was so good. First I didnt expect toreceive a full size.  It was so good very light and crunchy.  I am going to see if my local store has this cause it was too good not to get.  Thank you for sharing this with me.\n",
  "These are so awesome, they taste just like the crunchy corners of brownies. Which are my very favorite part. I will definitely buy more of these. The ones I shared friends said were addicting you had to have more than one. ",
  "I will be buying these again.  Get these!!! Okay sorry I was a bit excited.  I wasnt sure what to expect from these but was pleased to find their rich chocolate flavor appealing.  The thin pieces offer a nice crunch, but not to crunchy you have to soak them in milk.  Another fact is that they arent heavy in calories.  If you crave a quick sweet nibble the brownie bites are simply perfect.  If they arent in a store near you there is a website where you can pick them up.  Beware you are NOT going to want to share them.",
  "I can not say enough good stuff about this product. I have repurchased 3 times since getting this item in the mail. My favorite is the Salted Caramel. Sweet, salty, delicious. This tastes just like the corner pieces of brownie that are stuck to the edges. So so so good. The price was not bad on it either. I found it at Marc&#39;s (an Ohio owned store), for $2.50. They definitely earned the Best New Snack Product of the year award with flying colors. I strongly suggest going out and trying this! \n",
  "I really liked the Brownie Brittle. It is so delicious and I loved the added chocolate chips. I am a chocoholic and this was a great snack. I am looking forward to getting more so I can share with my family!\n",
  "Thanks to Swaggable for the FREE Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle! I definitely enjoyed the snack. I would have been a much bigger fan without the chip part. I think just chocolate brownie brittle would have been better. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend (and already have) that others try this item, and I&#39;d buy it myself!\n",
  "This was unlike any other sweet snack I&#39;ve tried.. I loved it. It was just like the crusty edge of a brownie, my favorite part!!  I would definitely buy this product on a regular basis!!  Im so glad I had the opportunity to try this..Thank you\n",
  "I loved trying Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle by Sheila G. it was delicious. I like the crispy texture and the chocolatly taste.  I also like the fact that there were only 120 caolories a serving, that was a big plus for this big flavor delicious snack.\n",
  "I like the idea of the brittle. It is still rich like a brownie, and I feel satisfied after a couple bites, but I don&#39;t feel bad after eating more than I think I should, and it isn&#39;t sugary sweet. Plus, it satisfied my chocolate cravings in a fun and tasty way, I want to try other flavors now. \n",
  "So delicious! Crunchy and flavorful! Chocolate chips and brownie equal heaven! Goes perfect with a tall glass of milk. I love how crunchy tasty each bite is.",
  "Love this product!! very tasty and easy to enjoy.I love the crispness of the brownie brittle and the flavor was great. To tell the truth I ate most of the bag the first day I recieved the package. Great Product and would make a great gift for a foodie. \n",
  "I absolutely loved Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle! It actually tasted like brownies and was not at all hard like peanut brittle is. I would definitely buy this product. This is the kind of sweet snack that I would love to have in front of me while watching a good movie on the couch and it would be perfect for a late night treat. These brownie bites have got my approval! They were perfect!\n",
  "These are the most fun brownie brittles I&#39;ve tried! Actually, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve tried brownie brittles, I&#39;ve tried brownies, and I&#39;ve tried brittles. I don&#39;t actually like chocolate that much, but loved these! Both my fiance and I really liked them and finished the box super fast. I&#39;m saving one more for a fun time to eat with a cup of nice tea! :)\n",
  "I already am a choco-holic so anything chocolate is good to me! Brownie brittle is delicious! Its tastes like brownies but they are convenient to eat and take on the go!\n",
  "These things were AWESOME! I was a little doubtful when I received them thinking how good can a crispy brownie really be?. They were SOOOO GOOD! I was pleasantly surprised! I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes choocolate and brownies. :) Two thumbs up!\n",
  "I really don&#39;t know what to say other than these are simply THE BEST THING EVER. Seriously. THE BEST THING EVER. \n",
  "First, I must say that I appreciated the large sample size. My whole family was able to enjoy it. With that being said, I like the idea of the product, but I felt it could have been executed better. I was looking for a home-baked, crispy taste. I felt that these had a more processsed taste and was crunchy and hard, not crispy. Also, they were too sweet for me. I got more of a sugary flavor than a chocolate one.\n",
  "Omg.. love this stuff! Its like someone took the best parts of a brownie (the edges) and put them in a bag just for me!  Who can I hug for this?  I tried the chocolate chip flavor and they were fantastic! Even crumbled some on some ice cream! Out of this world! ",
  "I got the chocolate chip flavor, and while chocolate chip isn&#39;t usually my favorite flavor in snacks; I absolutely loved this.  I was actually surprised that the chocolate taste is so rich, I thought it wouldn&#39;t have much of a flavor due to it being so crisp.  Usually when things are this crisp they tend to be dry, but these are very moist.  It has little chocolate chips on each piece, I love this attention to detail.  They are very addictive, I&#39;m trying to save some for tomorrow but it is hard.  My son also thinks they are very good.  It is an easy way to take a snack on the go as well.    \n",
  "This brownie brittle was really good. The smell from it was so inviting. I loved the taste. I decided to make this at home and i came close but not as good as this. I loved the size. What i did not like about this product was it had a lot of crumbs it broke very easy and at the bottom of this bag was just a big ole pile of chocolate dust. \n\nAlso did not like the fact that it disappeared to quickly. Before i knew it the bag was empty :)\n",
  "Not the typical soft or cornor cut brownie! these are your on the go treat that goes any place. You get that nice and super crunchy bite, a smooth chocolaty flavor with chips galore, and fresh chocolate smell. No one will ever deny these aren&#39;t good! You take a bite and its like heaven in your mouth. One piece is great but a whole bag is like a lifetime of pleasure. :)\n",
  "I loved this I had to fight my husband for the bag. Low calories all natural and delicious brownie snack. I will be buying more asap!\n",
  "I love Brownie Bittle, it is so tasty and so good.  I like brownie but it&#39;s always too sweet for me, but with Brownie Brittle, it&#39;s totally perfect.  When I first opened the bag, the smell of chocolate made we want a bite immediately.  And when I tried to first bite, I was addicted to it.  It is crispy, crunchy, plus the flavor of chocolate and chocolate chip make it delicious.  Thank you Swaggable to letting me try a wonderful snack.  I will definitely buy it more.\n",
  "Plain & simple, these are delicious!! I have to say the word brittle threw me off a little, and I was very happy to find that these are cookies! Although I read the description, I imagined a candy, such as peanut brittle or toffee. I don&#39;t think there are any cookies as light, crispy and chocolaty as these available anywhere! These are seriously yummy! The Fam-Bam wanted more, and were coming up with ideas on how to use them with other snacks, like ice cream toppings and trail/snack mixes! \n",
  "This is a great snack!  Light, crunchy, airy and chocolatey!  The chocolate chips on the top are an added bonus.  They really do taste like brownies, with less than half the fat of real brownies!  My daughter enjoyed them too.  I will definately be buying these in the future.\n",
  "I have noshing on this product for three days. I am in love with the taste! I am always trying to get the corner brownie (i love the edges), this way I dont have to even worry about it! I would buy this product a million times over! I can&#39;t wait to try the caramel flavor!!!\n",
  "This is the best sweet snack that I&#39;ve had in a long time! It has the texture of a cookie but the yumminess of a brownie. I couldn&#39;t keep these all to myself, I gave one bag to my parents so they could try them too and they loved them! I would recommend you go out and buy these right now! Don&#39;t wait, go now! And don&#39;t forget your glass of milk.  :-)\n",
  "This is so good.  It has the taste and feel of the edge corner brownies when you bake them giving them that crispy taste!",
  "This stuff is delicious! It&#39;s chewy like a brownie but crunchy like a cookie... and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s gotta be better for you since it&#39;s smaller pieces you aren&#39;t eating a whole bunch of fat like you would be if you ate a traditional brownie, not that I&#39;d care anyway... but it&#39;s also less messy to eat then a traditional brownie and has the same fudgey taste. Not fake at all like some cookies you get off the shelf\n",
  "These are delicious! I&#39;m eating this as I&#39;m writing this!  I guess this is my breakfast. Lol. I love the crispness and taste. I would highly recommend this.\n",
  "Oh My Goodness... I&#39;ve never heard of this product until I received it from Swaggable!! Simply Ah-May-Zing!!!!  I&#39;m not a big chocolte fan!! BUT i just fell in love w/ Brownie Brittle. I hope that my local Publix carry this product!!!!\n\nI let a coworker sample ONE, and i had to take the bag from him. Needless to say this bag didn&#39;t even make it 12hrs. I feel like i just Need more!!!\n\n \n",
  "I am so glad I got to try this brownie brittle! I received the chocolate chip flavor. My kids and I absolutely loved it. It is sort of like when you make homemade brownies or cupcakes and some of the batter gets on the pan you&#39;re cooking it in and it bakes. I love to eat those little pieces. It is also like the cruncy outer edges of the brownies, the end pieces. That is exactly what it tastes like. It is crispy but not too hard. It has the perfect texture actually. Similar to a cookie. They have a wonderful flavor. I was expecting them to be bland like most healthy chocolate foods are but they&#39;re nothing like that. They are very rich and decadent. Full of chocalety goodness. The only thing I did not like about them was the bag wasn&#39;t big enough! Will definitely be searching these out to get more. Thanks, Sheila G and Swaggable. These are a definite winner!\n",
  "Thet like a real brownie and im on a diet but a read that tehe  large portion size for only 120 calories, so i have to try them. I they are very good!!\n",
  "I actually have tried these before i got them and I am in love with them. The taste is like something i have never tried before. It&#39;s so crispy and delicious. It&#39;s really hard to find them in stores though and i buy them from a floral shop in the next town over. They are ridiculously expensive though over here. It&#39;s like $6 a bag and the bag is a little bigger than the one i got from my sampling but i still think its pricey. I only buy them occassionally as a treat because i cant help myself. They knew they would get people hooked lol. Simply delicious and indulgent.\n",
  "OMG!!! This is amazing!!!! I couldn&#39;t stop eating it! I am not a chocolate fan to begin with but this is just the best thing I have tasted in a while! It&#39;s perfect for snaking and has the perfect taste to go with the texture! I am so pleased to be able to try this!!!! A little info about the product is:\n\nLove the crispy crunchy edges of a rich gourmet brownie? Then you owe it to yourself to try Award-Winning Brownie Brittle™ snacks by Sheila G. Named as a hot item by WeightWatchers.com® (only 120 calories/ounce), Brownie Brittle snacks are peanut-free, certified-Kosher, made with natural ingredients, and were named Best New Snack Product of the year by the National Confectionery Sales Association. No more fighting for that corner piece with Brownie Brittle snacks!\n\n \n\nI can&#39;t say it any better! It is amazing!!!!! I&#39;m in love!\n",
  "oh my goodness these are amazing and i shared these at work and all the girls ask where to get these i think these are a must try and i will definitly be buying for me and my family for snack time\n",
  "i love it the texture was extra crispy without being greasy or having any sort of burnt taste.\n",
  "I loved these! They&#39;re so light and airy, but still packed with flavor and very crunchy. This is better than other types of brittle, which can be really hard on the teeth. This was just like eating a cookie only better. The chocolate chips were amazing. My daughter loved these also. I would definitely recommend brownie brittle to someone else, and definitely plan on buying it in the future. I&#39;ve never tried anything like this before, and I&#39;m glad I got the opportunity to. The only problem is that it&#39;s gone too fast! \n",
  "We got the opportunity to try Brownie Brittle through Swaggables. We took the whole bag over to a dinner party with mix company adults and kids.  When I say this bag did not last I mean it DID NOT last.  It was empty in less than 10 minutes and the adults were crying more than the kids because this tasty treat was gone!  Very good tasting, and satisfies that chocolate need.  Thank you Swaggables for the chance to try something new.  \n",
  "ok  so i got a free bag of this from  Swaggable  today  and i have to say  i loved it !!  when we ( my son and i) opened the bag it was like  opening a bag full of brownies  and yes  they taste like them as well i would reccomend this product . loved the big brownie taste without having to bake them myself nor  the mess  and they were not in  dust bits like one would figure even after going through the mail  LOVED THEM !!!\n",
  "Dearest Swaggable,\n\nWhat have you done to me? You send me 2 bags of the Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle and caused a major flavor attack and a new obsession!! These things didn&#39;t make it in my house for more than a day without being ripped into and consumed. First of all these taste BETTER than just edges of a brownie, these are chocolatey, crunchy, not dry and stale or burned and that is what i usually expect a brownie edge to be like. You bite into these and instantly it melts in your mouth with every satisfying crunch. The only con to this is that you only sent 2 bags!\n\n \n",
  "These Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittles were a hit at my house and at my husbands work.\n\nFirst off, everyone loves the crispy part of the brownie! So to have a bag of just the cripsy part was amazing. The flavor was right on!  Perfect brownie flavor.The crunch was just the right crispiness, not so hard you&#39;ll break a tooth but not wimpy or airy. My husbands coworkers raved about how delicious they were and were asking where to buy more. Both the Junk food junkies and the healt food nuts were in love with Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle.\n",
  "I received 2 small bags compliments of Swaggable of the Shelia G&#39;s  Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. Upon receiving my bag I couldn&#39;t wait to rip them open and try them. I was a little surprised upon opening the bag because they look more like a chip or cracker instead of what I call Brittle. However the taste of these remind me of the crusty edges around your brownies that you bake yourself. They taste wonderful!!  I love the fact that these come in small packages to because these would make great snacks for children to take to school, or even to throw in your purse for a snack when your on the go. They also come in Toffee Crunch that sounds awesome! They also come in Salted Carmel, and a Mint Chocolate Chip that I am sure my mother would enjoy.  I would recommend these to anyone that loves brownies! I will definetely be buying these again in the future for school lunch snacks and for on the go snacks for myself :) \n",
  "The chocolate chip brownie brittle taste like the crispy ends of brownies, its chrunchy and sweet. I would recommend this to people who enjoy the end pieces of brownies. I would buy chocolate chip brownie brittle. ",
  "These are delicious. Appearance wise they remind me of like chocolate teddy grahams or something but the taste is dead on to the crispy bits you get on the edge of the brownie pan. The amount of brittle in the bag is more than enough for one or two people. They are very rich and are a great way to get a quick sweet fix.  Three of four of the members of my household loved them, the fourth didn&#39;t care for them at all. She&#39;s weird though. haha. I would be interested to see if there are additional flavor combinations. I would LOVE to see some gluten free options.\n",
  "oh my goodness!! absolutely amazing!! ate a whole bag in less than 5min!! so much for my awesome weight loss after baby lol!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!\n",
  "These were great! They tasted just like the crunchy edges of the brownies. My favorite part! I really like the choc chips",
  "The brownie brittle bites were very good they tasted just like brownies. that i bake at home i also loved how each piece had the chocola chips on top. my kids loved them also .they tryed to eat them all. the fact they were crispy made the taste even better.",
  "Tastes good & my kids liked it too!  We enjoyed eating it :)  And it does remind me of edges of a brownie.",
  "This is definetly a go to snack if you want something sweet and crunchy. I love the flavor and the little chocolate chips in the brownie brittle add a glass of milk and you may be tempted to eat the whole bag. Four pieces of brittle is only 120 calories if you savor every bite that can be very satisfying. I would sertainly recommend this snack to someone looking for a brownie fix.\n",
  "I absolutely LOVED these!!!  I&#39;m a crunchy brownie kind of person, and I so totally dug these.  They were so yummy, delicious, good.  Holy cow. lol  I seriously sat down and ate the entire bag in one sitting, they were that good.\n\nThe only thing that&#39;s negative about them is that they&#39;re pretty pricey in the stores, and they&#39;re pretty hard to find...\n\n \n",
  "YUMMY!!!!!!!!!! The chocolate chip brownie brittle is soooo delicious. I have to limit myself so that they will last. They taste just like brownies but with a crispy crunch. These make a nice treat after a long day. so rich and indulgent. \n",
  "You know when you cook a pan of brownies and they get a bit crisp around the edges. If those edge pieces are the ones you love, then Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was made for you. From the smell of chocolate when you open the bag to the crispy taste, these brittle pieces are chocolatey goodness!\n\nFor a processed food, the ingredients for this product aren&#39;t too bad. This serving size has 4 g fat and 14g of sugar, but I definitely feel like my sweet tooth has been satisfied for the day.\n\nThis was an awesome sample from Swaggable--2, 2 oz bags. I would definitely recommend this brittle--especially for chocolate lovers!\n",
  "I didn&#39;t really know what to expect when I got offered to sample these, but I must say I am SO GLAD I did!!! Intense, rich chocolate flavor, crispy, and melt-in-your-mouth all in one bite! Personally, my favorite part of home-made brownies is the crispy corner pieces, and this is like having a whole bag of just that part! Great as a bed-time snack with milk, or an emergency chocolate fix whenever! The size of the bag is perfect for sharing too!!! Thanks so much for introducing Sheila G&#39;s into my life!!!\n",
  "Would I recommend this product sure. Its very versatlile, you can crunch them up on top of cake or ice cream, or an ice cream shake even. However by itself its a bit dry and you will DEFINITELY need some milk. The taste wasn&#39;t mindblowing, or chewy like I expect a brownie to be; but it wasn&#39;t bad either. I did like the chocolate chips in it, I felt it gave it a bit of richness, I also like that they have other flavors and wouldn&#39;t mind trying the salted caramel, or mint chocolate chip. Now that I know what I can do with them I can have more fun with brownie brittle.\n",
  "These are fantastic.  If you like the crunchy edges from brownies, you will LOVE these! There are a lot in a bag, and I had a hard time putting them down.  Then I looked at the back of the bag and didn&#39;t feel so bad! 120 cal/ounce! Yes! Unbelievable! Seriously chocolatey - delicious! I highly recommend.\n",
  "My whole family enjoyed the Choclate Chip Brownie Brittle sample.  We had the hardest time getting it away from dad.  It really does taste amazing, with giving you a little taste of something chocolate and not eating a whole brownie.  I would buy these myself and highly recommned.\n",
  "I love these chocolate chip brownie brittle. I thought the maker thought of a great product. I amnot that much of a brownie eatter but with these being like cookies was great. The rest of my family that i live with tried them and liked them awell.\n",
  "Yes I would recommend it since it so addictive. Once you eat it you can&#39;t stop.I love the taste of it. Yes I would buy it as I speak my son is eating it now. :)\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is awesome! My whole family loves it. It is great on its own or added to ice cream, yogurt or just about anything else. The only problem I see with it is that once I get started, I can&#39;t seem to stop eating it! I will definitely buy it and try some of the other flavors and recommend it to my friends.\n",
  "                                                                                                                                                                                           12 i loved the brownie brittle that i got from swaggable the taste was so good i had to share with a mykids i would recommend this to everyone love the brownie taste in a bag without baking it i would buying this for sure thanks swaggable for such a great product .\n",

I cant wait to use my coupon and buy all the flavors!!\n",
  "Let me tell you how much I love Shiela G&#39;s brownie brittle!  I am not a fan of regular peanut brittle; but I love brownies, especially the end pieces.  This brittle tastes exactly like brownies and the chocolate chips make them even richer in flavor.  The crunch is just like eating a chocolate chip cookie and it definitely makes it taste as if you are eating nothing but the cripsy ends of a batch of yummy brownies!  If you love brownies and you love crunchy sweet treats, this is definitely the treat for you!  Dieters or those watching their weight - no need to worry, you can enjoy this sweet treat too!  This is a Weight Watchers favorite and it does not even taste like a low calorie food!  It was so fun sampling this product and it is definitely one that I will purchase again in the future.  Great treat over the holiday season!\n",
  "They are amazing! They taste awesome. Even my husband loved them. They are crunchy and soft at the same time. I could eat the whole bag at once. Will definitely buy some. ",
  "As I opened the box and looked they were children were very excited.\nBrought together the whole family and some neighbors to come and try the new product and what was my astonishment that everyone loved it (children, old, men, women, all).\nConsistency is a cookie but tastes a brownie, delicious cookies sparks, definitely going to buy and I will use my coupon for 50 cents off.\nDefinitely recommend this product because it is made with more natural ingredients.\nI&#39;d love to try the other flavors, to see if rich taste as these.\n",
  "This stuff was awesome. The bag was completely empty a few hours after it was delivered. The crispy texture reminded me of what I scrape from the bottom and corners of the brownie pan. Am looking for these to hit the stor shelves so I can try the other flavors too",
  "THESE ARE AMAZING! SO delicious! I took one of the two bags given and brought it up to work with me,. I was SO upset once I devoured it that I didnt bring the second bag into work! The chocolate chips are real, like they melt in your mouth and the entire product is delicious. I am a huge chocolate fan and these will be repurchased MANY times over! \n",
  "The Brownie Brittle was amazing to say the least!!  Everyone in my house absolutely loved it!!  The only thing now I need to know what stores this is sold in?\n",
  "For anyone that loves the crispy edges of brownies, you will absolutely love this product. I cant wait to run out and pick up some more.",
  "I was thrilled when I saw Swaggable sent me a full sized bag of Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle.\n\nThe crunch is amazing, and the flavor is even better. I had to keep myself from putting my hand in the bag many times! My husband also loved it.\n\nIts very chocolatey too, and I say that in a good way. We will definitly be using the coupon that came with the product to purchase more.\n",
  "My family LOVED these. They tasted like real brownies, but in a chip-like form. The kiddos really enjoyed them. Fun chocolate snack. Who doesn&#39;t love chocolate?!!  I would buy these as treats every now and then. \n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is now a favorite snack in my house. As soon as we opened the bag, the smell enticed each of us to dig in. My daughter said that they tasted just like a brownie and asked if I could go buy her a bag of her own. My son was too busy eating them to say too much about them. My husband absolutely loved the brownie brittle. He isn&#39;t a big sweets fan, but he really enjoys brownies. He took a bite of one, made that appreciative sound he makes, and took off with the bag. \n\nSo, what did I think of the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle? It is delicious! I am not a huge brownie fan, but these were so wonderfully crunchy! I was afraid with the name brittle, that they would be hard instead of crisp. That is not an issue. These combine the taste of the crispy edge of baked brownies, the crunchiness of my favorite cookies, and the ease of a grab and go snack. I will be looking for these on my next trip to the store. \n",
  "My fiancé especially loves this.  He likes the crispy ends of brownies.  Nice little treat!",
  "I really liked the taste of the browney brittle , so did my kids. They had such a rich choclate taste. They were the perfect texture not too soft or crunchy. I am not sure of the price but I would not pay more than $2.50 per bag.\n",
  "My entire family loves Sheila Gs Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. My 9 year old said its her new favorite snack. We love the chocolatey flavor and the crunchy texture. Its like eating the yummy side of a homemade brownie without the mess. Its a perfect on the go snack. I will definitely be stocking my pantry with these from now on. ",
  "This was the best thing I have ever sampled from here.",
  "These brownie brittle are a great snack and I would recommend them to everyone that has really good teeth since they are very crunchy and make it very hard for ppl that don&#39;t have teeth to eat them, they taste great and if your not careful, you will evat eht whole bag before you even realize it, I would buy these but next time I would dip them in milk so I can enjoy them a little more.\n",
  "The one word I can think of to describe this is AWESOME!! I happened to have a house full the day these were delivered. Everyone loved them. I had to fight to get the hag to try them myself. I need to find them & stock them ASAP!!",
  "Super fun and tasty snack! Very chocholoteity and crunchy. Will be using coupon to get more!",
  "The Brownie Brittles really give you a great chocolate brownie flavor without having to bake and in a better snack sized portion.  Normally I like the undercooked center of brownie pan selection, but these gave me a new respect for the crispy end bits. My ONLY suggestion is somehow be a little more low calories, as these seem the equivalent of the baked chips option.  Definitely worth trying out. \n",
  "I am in love with Brownie Brittle!  What a great idea, it&#39;s chocolatey and crisp like a wafer, and tastes just like a brownie.  I received my sample and shared with my co workers.  We then went to Safeway and bought two bags each!  Super good if you want a yummy chocolate treat.  Great with milk too!\n",
  "I LOVE this product! I was super excited when I got it! The flavor is perfect - It taste like a brownie! My daughter loved it too! I probably would not buy this product just because its like if you were to make brownies yourself and some of it got stuck to the pan - you just scrape it off and bag it. But it was a fun, delicious sample thank you! \n",
  "Got the brownie brittle and it was delissssssh. I got 2 of them so hobby and i did not fight about them. Those  brownies are like cookies With the brownie flavor - love them ",
  "These brownie brittle bites are delicious!! I love the crunch of them with the whole chocolate chunks. I can&#39;t wait to find these in a store to buy more of them. \n",
  "I was a little unsure about how much like the edge of a brownie this would taste,but I was surprisingly and happily wrong.I opened the package and was immediately greeted with the scent of brownies.I took a piece out and observed it and loved how there were chocolate chips in it and they stuck out somewhat,giving the brittle dimension.I was afraid it might be too hard like some brittles,but I was greeted with a light and airy crunch as I bit into it.I enjoyed the subtle chocolate flavor and feeling of eating a brownie.I was also happy there wasn&#39;t an overwhelming chocolate flavor like other products.I would definitely suggest to give this a chance if you love brownies,but want a lower calorie option.\n",
  "I have to say i Loved this they taste great and they were so good, easy to take on the go but just so delicous. I was nervous becasue it did not sound good but i wasw rong i think i rather have this than an actual brownie. If you love chocolate you have to give these a try best product i have tried in a long time. Nice for a good snack or good a little indulgance with milk or coffee. These are great can&#39;t wait to go buy some more of them. \n",
  "These were the  best little yummy treat! very rich but not too rich and borken into snack size squares. I was able to pack them in my kids lunches! Would but these all the time!\n",
  "i love them smell yummy when you open the package. delicious , the texture was that of a wafer thin cookie and it tasted like a brownie. was not expecting it to be this good, will definatly buy them!!\n",
  "I know this is called brownie brittle, but I was expecting it to taste like a chocolate chip cookie.  I was so wrong.  They taste just like a pan of freshly baked brownies...the corners atleast.  I am a fan of the ooeey gooeey middle of the brownie pan, but these were still great.  I even shared with my coworkers and they all raved about them.  One even hopped online to find where she can go buy them from. The other flavors look great and I can&#39;t wait to them as well.\n",
  "I loved the Brownie Brittle.  It is delicious and addictive.  I went through both of the sample bags and then I picked up a big bag at Costco.  If you like chocolate and you like brownies you have to try this out, but be warned you will want more.\n",
  "These taste fantastic! They taste like a brownie flavored cookie. love ...love...love it\n",
  "This brownie brittle was amazing! It tasted just like a brownie, I was concerned that it wouldnt have much flavor but it was just perfect! All I needed was a big glass of milk and I could sit and eat the whole bag. I would highly recommend this to all my family and friends. Brownie Brittle snacks are peanut-free, certified-Kosher, made with natural ingredients which makes it even more appealing. \n",
  "This was the BEST SNACK EVER! I love corner pieces, this was a bag of crispy, crunchy corner pieces. Nothing better. I loved this so much, I ran to the store and used my coupon immediately. I will continue to buy this snack as long as it is in my area! ",
  "The chocolate chip brownie brittle was delicious, it really does have a rich brownie taste with a cookie crunch like the packaging says. I love the corner piece of a brownie so this was perfect! I also like that this is made with natural ingredients. I would highly recommend this product and will be purchasing again for myself as well.\n",
  "These were delicious!  I couldn&#39;t believe that they are low fat.  I inhaled the whole bag in less than a day.  Lol.  Also gave my Neighbor a sample taste and he said on a scale of 1 to 10 they were a 9 and i also would give a 9.  Would definately purchase.\n",
  "My family and I thought they were awesome, very delicious just like the edge pieces of home made brownies.  Will definitely buy them.  Thanks for the sample.  ",
  "Unfortunately the bag that I received was damaged and the brownie crisps were stale.  They seemed like a product I would have enjoyed as the edges are the favorite part of brownies at my house.  Dissapointed that I had to throw these out  but they were not edible as is....",
  "I have to say that after the first bite I wasent a big fan. It was just different as any other brittle or snack. But after my second try things change! These are addictive. Is literaly the taste of a gourment brownie. They are sooo goood and not overly sweet. They are crunchy just like the description says. This was a hit in my house. Defianetly buying again\n",
  "I loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. My daughter is also a fan of it. I would buy this as a great snack for my kids and for me. Very good with a cold glass of milk.\n",
  "I love Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle not only because it feels light in my stomach but it tastes light as well. I currently share it as a snack with my family, plus I&#39;ve talked and showed it to my friends. \n",
  "OMG! These are the best thing EVER! Chocolatey, brownie-y, crispy and perfect bite size pieces!\n",
  "All I can say is oh my!!!!! These are so delish, the day i got them i saved them for after dinner and my husband, 4yr old, and I consumed both bags they are so awesome the whole family loved them. They have a great crunch but they are not hard the practically melt in your mouth, we will definitely be purchasing these !!\n",
  "This was simply amazing! Me and my husband couldn&#39;t stop eating it! As my husband said, its the best part of the brownie, like the outer crust.\n",
  "I have to tell you I think they really have something here because I enjoyed this product so much! I thought that the chocolate chip brownie brittle was so fantastic. It was a great snack and I enjoyed it so much. Once my husband found it they didnt last but a day but I went and bought more because we thought they were so delicious.",
  "Delicious and wonderfully crunchy texture.  I will be buying this in the future.  It tastes just like a great brownie but it is thin and cripsy like a cookie.  Has chocolate chips in it and made me wonder how did the chips seem to be crispy too?  Didn&#39;t think on that for too long because they were so yummy just wanted to eat the whole bag but I shared and my family loved them as well.\n",
  "yummmmm!!!!! the crispyness of this chocolate brownie snack was something to hit the chocolate craving spot! it&#39;s very addicting to eat too but knwoing that is only has 120 calories plus its kosher makes it just as fun!. i would highly recommend this to any chocolate brownie loving person out there. i would buy this as a cheat snack while dieting! i loved the taste of the brownie brittle, thank you!\n",
  "From the first second i popped a piece of this delicious brittle in my mouth, i became a fan. It&#39;s crunchy, has great texture, lots of chocolate chips (which is awesome), and best of all, is as chocolately as a product can get. Even my mother, who isn&#39;t a big fan of chocolate, admitted that these were really addicting. I would recommend these 100% and even bragged about them at work, much to the jealousy of my chocolate-loving co-workers. I love that the brittle peices are of good size and excellent crunch. They have the perfect amount of chocolate chips in each piece, which is enough to make the brittle crunchy and gushy with sweet, delicious chocolate. I would and am definitely going to hunt these down and buy them. Thank you, Sheila G., and thank you Swaggable for giving me the opportunity to try out this perfectly savory product.\n",
  "Out of our family of 5, 3 of us loved them. If your in the mood for brownies they take a while to make. These brownie brittles taste great and are a quick snack. I would recommend these to friends and family.  Thank you. :)",
  "i found this product to be very good.  i enjoyed it it a lot.  i normally am middle of the pan brownie but this was very good.  my fiance loved themt oo that he ate 90% of the bag and finished them off... also thinking that they could make a good sprinkle topping for ice cream or pies or something.. didnt get to try it that thought... verry enjoyable",
  "i didnt like it that much my dad said it was ok but id rather stick with peanut brittle\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle was so good! I brought it into work and the office devoured it. I need more! I liked that it tastes like a crisp brownie and in snack portions. I would definately recommend this and have already! I am looking to buy this on my next shopping trip.\n",
  "I received my sample of Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle and I have to say this is THE best thing I have tried on Swaggable so far! At first I wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d be a fan of it because I like more of a soft and gooey kind of brownie. I opened the bag and it smelled so goood!! They are light and crispy and very tasty! It makes for a really nice snack or treat and I love that it&#39;s made with natural ingredients. I would and have recommended this product to everyone! I hope to find these at my local store because I would love to try the other flavors.\n",
  "Wow!  What a great first product test from Swaggable!  LOVE  Chocolate Chip Bownie Brittle....can&#39;t wait to try the Chocolate Toffee version.  Imagine all the flavor of a brownie packed into a thin, crisp cookie and you&#39;ve started to understand how great these treats are!  It is amazing how much deep, fudgy flavor is packed into these crisps!  ....and, at 120 calories an oz., these are brownies that you can enjoy guilt-free, as long as you don&#39;t eat the whole bag at once that is!\n",
  "Yummy I love brownie I love chocolate I love curncy also it&#39;s kosher try it :-)\n",
  "I was surprised at how much I liked these. They taste just like brownies but with a crunchy texture.",
  "This is so good! I honestly was a little skeptical, and not sure at all how I would feel about it, but now I find myself with a half finished bag, and already wanting to buy more!\n\n \n\nMy husband says it tastes pretty similar to cocoa puffs. I agree- it would probably be really good broken into pieces like a cereal for a sweeter dessert. \n\n \n\nAs a chocolate lover, I love the flavor, and even the chocolate chips are nice and soft- it really felt like eating an edge piece a couple of days after baking. It also has less calories than most chocolate snacks, so it is perfect for the chocolate lover that wants to enjoy chocolate without all the guilt and calories associated with it!\n",
  "The Brownie Brittle was delicious.  I was a little skeptical about this product.  I thought it would be too sweet but it was perfect.  It is not as hard as conventional peanut brittle but it was crispy and flavorful.  My kids enjoyed it as well.  It will be a new item added to my grocery list!\n",
  "i really loved this sample ..it was so darn delicious. after it was gone i was wanting more.\n\ni would defitinely buy this.\n",
  "I didn&#39;t like it. It had a slightly burnt tatse to it. My brownie edges are always a bit tough/chewy and that was what I was hoping this would be like but these were straight up crunchy. I will not purchase.\n",
  "Brownie Brittle is so delicious!! While we dont typically snack on these types of food, it was a real received treat. ",
  "I shared with the kids and they,like myself had mixed feelings about this.It has a good chocolate flavor but a little too dry for me.I thought the bites with the chips would help that but they didn&#39;t.Over all we thought it was just ok...and probably not something we would buy.\n",
  "Me and my family LOVED the chocolate chip brownie brittle we received. I thought the idea was pretty neat. The brittle tasted great and did indeed taste like a brownie. It reminded me a lot of some biscotti that I have had before. This treat tastes great with milk and water! I did give it 5/5 stars in the flavor category due to the great taste but gave it just 4/5 in the fun factor category. This is due to the extreme crumbly-ness of the product. There was a pretty thick layer of crumbs at the bottom of the bag when the peices of brittle were gone. There was also quite a bit of crumbly-ness associated with the consuption of the product, making eating it a bit messy. Overall, I gave the product 4/5 stars.\n",
  "My family absolutely loved this product!  Amazing flavor; it tastes just like brownies, even if the texture is different.  And the texture is great.  Not crispy like chips or almond brittle, but perfect for the product.  I will definitely be buying more of this for the family.\n",
  "Love these! I do love the crisp part of the brownie and these taste like a brownie - spot on, its made with natural ingredients and the chocolate flavor is great, not at all cheap tasting. I love the addition of chocolate chips. \n\nAt 120 cal/oz its not too bad - compared to regular brownies. The only down size is that the pieces in the bag look like they all broken, maybe because its in a bag - I didnt find any big pieces. But either way they were still good.\n\nId buy these again, theyre fantastic. Its hard to stop eating them once you stop. \n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is so tasty! It is a quick easy snack that my son loves too!  I thought the flavor was great and it has a thin crispy texture. They go great with milk.  Deffinately a fun snack.\n",
  "I never thought it was possible to enjoy the corner piece in this fashion. The corner piece of the brownie is the best and Sheila G&#39;s nailed it! The taste, texture, and auroma are identical to eating a brownie. They don&#39;t cheat you on the chocolate chips which is plus as the chocolate chips are a nice contrast the crunchy brittle. \n\nI really enjoy how many of these you can eat without feeling guilty. I bought the full size bag and the serving size is six pieces for 120 calories. I only needed three pieces to satisfy my sweet tooth. Any other chocolate treat would tip the calories scale. \n\nI really want to try some oft he other flavors but I wasn&#39;t able to find them locally. I did find them on Amazon so I will be buying more soon! I&#39;m 100% satisfied with Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle and I&#39;m surprised by how much I enjoy them. I was excited to try them but I figured they wouldn&#39;t be able to deliver on their promise to provide me with that corner brownie piece experience. I underestimated Sheila G&#39;s and couldn&#39;t be happier. \n\nThis will be a new staple in my home! Thank you for letting me try it because this isn&#39;t something I would have found on my own. \n",
  "I was a little skeptical when I was offered Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle to review. First I&#39;ve never heard of the Sheila G brand before and I&#39;ve actually never eaten a brownie brittle either. Boy was I surprised when I got it. Not only did it taste good but it didn&#39;t last long enough in my house either. My toddler was the first to get her hands on it and before I knew it 1/2 of the package was already gone. I loved the resealable package that it came it which means that it can be saved for later without having to worry about something crawling inside. Unfortunately because it tastes so good there would never be left overs. It has a light but sweet taste and I love the fact that they were peanut free and made with natural ingredients. They&#39;re only 120 calories/ounce but be prepared to be eating more than that. They are so good you won&#39;t be able to help yourself. \n",
  "Wow, We really enjoyed the Brownie Brittle!  It was a great snack that we enjoyed as a family!  My kids are begging for us to go buy more!  It was delicious!  The bag had just enough for everybody to get their fair share too!  I could not believe the calories were so low either, it tasted so good!!!!  I will definately be buying some soon!!!\n",
  "I loved everything about this product and shared it with friends. It was a party hit. I will buy this product.\n",
  "Thanks so much to Swaggable and Sheila G. for letting me try out this awesome product! Sheila G.&#39;s Brownie Brittle is one of the best new snack product I&#39;ve tried in a long time. With only 120 calories its a guilt free snack that tastes great! My family and friends love it as well! I&#39;ve told a bunch of people about it and I shared my complementary samples that I had received and it was a big hit! I have also discovered that they sell it in a very big bag at our local wholesale club. I was told that that&#39;s the bag we need to get next time. This product was a great find! Thanks so much Swaggable and Sheila G.&#39;s for my complementary bags!\n",
  "I loved the taste of the brownie batter brittle. It was in a gorgeous package and a nice size also. I love that they are featured on weight watchers and only 120 calories per ounce. Too bad I ate the whole bag and didnt even look at the nutrition information! ",
  "Packaging is a good size, pretty and well designed.  Taste is great and I would definitely buy if available in my area. This is a unique idea and Im glad the company thought of it! ",
  "I LOVE THIS! Oh my god, i have never been so overwhelmed tasting a new thing. It tastes exactly like a corner brownie of a freshly baked tray. And they sent the snack size !! It was SO BIG, 4 oz? I sat there an ate in in a day! WILL BUY MORE MOST DEFINATELY. I even have friends/family buying it, it&#39;s that good!\n",
  "Thought this product was really good. It had a good flavor, was in a nice sized bag and loved that they were named a hot item by WeightWatchers.com. If I saw these in my local grocery store, I would probably buy them.\n",
  "This is an awesome product...very very very good! I would buy this product if it wasn&#39;t so pricey. That&#39;s the only bad thing about the product. It costs too much.\n",
  "These were delicious! It was the right amount of crunch and flavor! My family loves them and we will be buying lots more. \n",
  "LOVE this product!  I really want to try the other flavors!\n",
  "Looking for a yummy, chocolatey, crunchy snack that does not make you feel guilty after? Then look no further. Sheila G.&#39;s Brownie Brittle is made with natural ingredients and, at 120 calories per serving, you can&#39;t help but eat two servings.\n\nCheck out my full review here: http://msarroyohpca.blogspot.com/2013/10/sheila-gs-brownie-brittle-review.html\n",
  "I was real surprised with this brownie brittleI. I really expected it to be the typical hard, chip you teeth, kind of brittle. Instead, It was light and crisp and full of flavor. I really think this product will be a hit with the consumers.\n",
  "I was pleasantly surprised when this sample arrived in my mail. It is (or looks to be) the *actual size* you would buy in the store!  I cannot tell you how GOOD these brownie brittle bites are!!! I am a chocoholic, so this treat really hits the spot for me! :-) I will be scoping out my grocery store this week to find them and use the coupon I received. Would I recommend these?? Heck yeah!\n",
  "This had a very chocolatey taste, however, it also tasted slightly burned and dry. It is a nice snack with low calories for that sweet fix but I do not think I will ever buy them. I did give the second bag to a friend who absolutely loved them and cannot wait to find them in the store. She thought they were like a chocolate chip cookie with a brownie taste. It is a fun idea and I am sure many will like them so do not be afraid to give them a try.\n",
  "When I saw this in my mailbox, I couldnt wait to try it, and I was not disappointed! Even though it is a thin crisp, it tastes just like a brownie. I enjoyed it by itself, but it would probably be great crumbled over some vanilla ice cream as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves brownies. I cant wait to look for it when I go to the store!",
  "Oh my gosh these were soooo good I ate the whole bag by myself lol I didnt want to share! This was such a great idea me and my sister would always fight for the crunchy parts now theres no need to!",
  "This stuff is great! It&#39;s like the crunchy part of the brownie that you don&#39;t always get to eat.  The chocolate chips are wonderful!  It was almost impossible not to eat the entire bag in one sitting.  The sample size I got to try was a very generous amount.  I will be buying more of this.  My boss probably will too.  I took the bag to work and she tried it and also love it!  Very crunchy, great sweet snack.  This would go perfect with a nice cold glass of milk!  I&#39;m happy they included a coupon on a future purchase.  I will definately be using it soon!  LOVED IT!\n",
  "This brownie brittle was amazing.  Like a large number of people that I know, I am a huge fan of the crispy, crunchy brownie edges.  I was a little scared that these were going to have a slightly greasy/oily coating to them, but they didn&#39;t have that at all.  They were a huge hit with everyone in the house.  Even my super picky four year old dug right in.  We will definitely be purchasing these in the future!\n",
  "These brownie bites are a great snack. My husband and I always fight over the edges of the brownies and these bites are just those. I like the bite-sized pieces with a nice crunch. Takes just like a brownie. I would recommend these brownie brittles to any brownie lover.\n",
  "These brownie brittle bites did not stand a chance in my household! I really enjoyed how crunchy and flavorful they were. The calorie count is just enough to make me not feel guilty about eating them as well. I highly suggest eating them with a glass of milk. I would buy these in a heart beat if I saw them in stores!\n",
  "These were very yummy, even better when you dip them in milk! loved loved these!!\n",
  "My family and I really enjoyed this wonderful snack.  The flavor was great and we enjoyed the crispy texture.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to try a new exciting snack.\n",
  "I couldn&#39;t wait to try these. When I opened the bag chocolate filled the air. I tasted a couple they were great. Tasted just like homemade brownies. Then I got to a couple pieces that were burnt. The pieces that wasn&#39;t burnt tasted great but the bitterness of the burnt pieces disappointed me.\n",
  "We recieved our sample of Brownie Brittle. I was surprised to find a whole bag for the whole family to share. Each piece was full of chocolate chips. My entire family loved this product. These are like having the corner piece of the brownie. I would recommend these and I plan on buying them for the family again. \n",
  "My family LOVED these Brownie Brittle bites. The bag was completely empty within two days of receiving the product. My husband said his favorite part of the brownie pan is the crispy edges, so this hit the spot for him. \n",
  "Wow,I absolutely loved these.I had a hard time keeping them away from my family.I havealreadfy told several people about these.We cannot wait to try the other flavors though I couldn&#39;t find these at my local walmart. The flavor was awesome and it tasted like the crispy edges of a tray of brownies.Yum,can;t really say more than they were awesome.\n",
  "This is the more amazing syuff ever. My family and I were fighting over who would get to eat it all. I now have to go buy a couple more bags to try it on some vanilla ice cream. I thingk that the crunchy brownie flavor would be so yummy on it. If you haven&#39;t had it, It&#39;s a whole bag filled with all of the crunchy bits that are on the top when you make brownies. It is soooooo yummy I gotta go get more.\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Original Brownie Brittle is a delicious snack that comes in a variety of flavors to choose from. I was able to try the chocolate chip brownie brittle, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. In my opinion, the edges on a pan of brownies is the best tasting part. Brownie Brittle takes all those delicious, crunchy edges, turns them into perfect bite sized squares and stuffs them in a nicely designed bag for your enjoyment. Ringing in with only 120 calories an oz, they are peanut free, Kosher, made with natural ingredients and were named Best New Snack Product of the year! Besides being named a new hot item by Weight Watchers, the bottom line is I love them, my family loves them, and I definitely recommend getting a bag for yourself because you&#39;ll love them too! I will be buying again in the future. Especially with flavors like Toffee Crunch, Chocolate Chip, Salted Caramel and Mint Chocolate Chip! :)\n",
  "Love love loved chocolate chip brownie brittle. The crispy crunchy taste of brownie with only 120 calories per ounce. Satisfiy&#39;s my sweet tooth!\n",
  "Im not sure what I was expecting when I got these in the mail.  I had seen them in the store, but had never tried them.  \n\nI opened the box as soon as it was delivered, and was excited to see a full sized bag of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle.  I opened it up and it was like opening a bag of brownies.  The smell was delicious.  I pulled a piece out.  It was hard and flat.  There were bunches of chocolate chips in each bite.  I popped it in my mouth.  I knew that I was hiding them from my kids.  My husband was lucky I shared with him.  \n\nOur favorite part of a brownie is the crust.  The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was a bag of crunchy brownie crust.  Lots of chocolate chips.  Tons of flavor.  It was good.  Ill definitely be buying these as a treat in our house!",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was great I like the lightness and the crunch and how it taste so much like a real brownie the bag is a really good size i wont feel guilty eating it the pieces are a good size with alot of flavor I would defentlly recommened it i shared some with family they also liked it and i would buy it int the future the reason I gave it a four stars is because to me they are bit sweet thats just me but did enoy them \n",
  "These were AMAZING!  I can not wait to try every flavor.  I am one that LOVES the crunchy edges on brownies and these tasted EXACTLY like them.  If you are a lover of brownies then you HAVE TO try these.  Plus the ingredients are natural and it&#39;s a lot less fattening than an actual brownie.  :)\n",
  "This brownie bittle is so delicouos!!! I love the rich chocolate taste and is such a great snack for my kiddos and I!!\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle is inspired by her love of the crispy edges of brownies. She tried to create a product that would be like just the crunchy edges. It&#39;s an interesting concept that doesn&#39;t quite work for me.\n\nI love brownies, and I prefer the corner pieces. However, I would rather have a regular brownie than this product. When I make brownies the edges are usually a bit more done, but the texture of the brownie brittle is more like a burnt cookie or cracker. The texture makes it easy to overindulge on these without feeling satisfied, and I didn&#39;t even notice the chocolate chips because the crunchiness of these is so overpowering. Although these are chocolately, the strongest element of the taste is sugar. There were also a bunch of crumbs at the bottom of the bag.\n\nI also don&#39;t like that the packaging says this snack is made with natural ingredients, because that implies that it is healthier, which it definitely is not. Enriched wheat flour is no better than white flour. Palm oil is one of the worst oils. Then there is corn syrup, carmel color and natural flavor. I also don&#39;t consider a product like this to be a snack, which to me is fruit or some carrots and hummus.\n\nI do eat junk food, which I consider this product to be, occassionally. However, I would not try this product again or recommend it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the calories, because it&#39;s not satisfying.\n",
  "OMG I got my sample in the mail last week I love these! I hope some stores in my area start carring them! I cant wait to try the other flavors!!! I highly recommend this product!\n",
  "I actually didn&#39;t know that I would like this product so well.  I am a fan of the soft and chewy brownies in the middle of the pan.  These were really good, though.  I love the addition of the chocolate chips.  They have a cracker-like texture with the flavor of a brownie.  My kids really enjoyed these, too.  My favorite part was that they didn&#39;t have a processed taste.  They taste like the brownies you make at home.  They also don&#39;t taste like a low-calorie food, which is definitely a good thing.\n",
  "I absolutely loved these.  I was very hesitant to try, but after dinner one night while we had company over, I had a sweet tooth.  We rarely keep cookies or anything sweet around, so I opened the bag and offered some to my friend.  He wouldn&#39;t take it until I ate it first.  I said, Wow, these are actually really good.  He tasted one and thought it tasted just a little on the burned side.  But I thought they were fantastic, and just a few satisfied my sweet tooth.\n",
  "I cant even lie hands down brownie brittle was great my daughter and I couldnt stop eating these are a most buy I will be purchasing in the future ...",
  "This was so different from any other packaged sweet I&#39;ve tried. When you open the bag, it smells like frsh brownies out of the over. The taste is amazing and even though they are browny crisps, they are not dry. They taste like the egdes of a brownie. \n",
  "This is the best brownie brittle we have ever try my son who is 12 and don&#39;t like the sweet eat the whole bag and ask me to get more unfortunately not every store carry it and I can&#39;t find any in town.\n",
  "I would really recommend these yummy bites!  I love the crunch & the flavor!  The chocolate chips added a nice texture as well.  I don&#39;t usually buy treats but this would be a great addition to my pantry!  YUM\n",
  "I received a free sample of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle to try out.  These are so good!  Great chocolate brownie taste with a crunchy chip-like texture!  My whole family enjoyed them and we will be buying more.  I also love that they are peanut-free, so my neice can enjoy them as well.  I most definately recommend these to everyone!\n",
  "My family and I love chocolate chip brownie brittle. They are so light and crisp. They melt in your mouth and I love the little mini chocolate chips. They are definitely satisfied, I would recommend these to anyone wanting a low calorie fulfilling snack.",
  "Tastes just like the crunchy corners of brownies from the inside of the pan when you bake them! So good and goes great with coffee, yogurt or ice cream! So chocolaty and delicious ",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is so freaking awesome. I couldn&#39;t stop eating it. I really liked the taste and texture. This is overall hands down my favorite thing I have gotten from Swaggable to try. I really need to track down a store that sells it.\n",
  "When I received this package in the mail, I was very surprised! The brownie brittle came in a 4oz. foil pack, with postcard from the company displaying all four flavors. Before I continue, let me say now that brownies are great, but not my favorite sweet treat. That being said, I love this product!!! There was also a coupon included that I will definitely be using. \n\nThe advertising for this product states that it is based on the crispy crunchy edges of a rich gourmet brownie, it is NOT a false statement. I am one of those foodies and loves the outside edges of all baked goods and this product had me at first bite. Like most brittle, the product comes in flat squares, but these squares are very flaky and light. I received the chocolate chip flavored brittle and loved the fact that the chips were not huge and overpowering. The brownie taste was also not overpowering, leaving me with a true &#39;brownie/cookie&#39; type. \n\nI will be sharing with my friends (only because I have a coupon for more) and will recommend this product for all brownie lovers!\n",
  "Chocolate Goodness! Where have they been? \n\nOmg! When I got home I saw a package and when I opened it I saw this yummy deliciousness. When I open the bag I could smell the chocolate and I couldnt wait any longer and try it. Extremely delicious and good....the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is the best snack Ive tried in a long time.....even my sister loved it!  I love the crunchiness and the chocolate flavor, made out of Natural Ingredients and during the 2012-2013 was awarded the Best New Snack. A serving size its 1 oz and it has 120 calories so its a pretty awesome snack if you have a sweet tooth \n\nGive it a try and you will want more and more and is addictive but delicious! ",
  "I was a little hesitant to try the Brownie Brittle simply because I had never heard of it before. I must say, I was very surprised. I found the taste amazing. It very much IS like the crunchy corner or edge piece of homemade brownies. My children loved them and I loved that they were diet friendly! I would definitely recommend them to my friends and will definitely buy them when I see them. So good!\n",
  "me and my son absolutly loved these, the bag was gone in a couple days. \n\ni was afriad it would just taste like burnt brownie chippings, but no tatsed like a regular brownie in a cookie form just as it stated,\n\nmy only issue was very few large brittle pieces, by the time it got to me it was more just crumbs, but great used as an ice cream topping!\n",
  "this was good my kids ate it with milk and they like it chocolate chip brownie brittle was pretty good \n",
  "The product I received was delicious!! Such a good flavor. I really liked it because it tasted good and wasnt as hard as i thought itd be.",
  "I was VERY impressed and surprised by this product. If you read the back of the bag it says it&#39;s for all those people who love the crispy corners and edges of brownies... well that is definitely me! I will cut off only the very outer edges of entire tray of brownies to eat! I love the crispy not quite burned taste and brownie brittle definitely isn&#39;t lying when they say that is what they are aiming to be like. Although it is obvioulsy not the edges of a pan of brownies, it really did taste like it!! The brittle (as they call it) is really light but is packed with the rich chocolate brownie taste. I think I ate the whole bag in one day they were so good. I tried the original but saw that they make it in other flavors that look amazing! This would be a perfect topping for a bowl of ice cream (or just about anything for that matter). The *only* things I would change to make this better are, firstly the bottom of my bag was all crumbs, the pieces had broken up too small to really eat with your fingers like a chip but that probably was because it came in the mail and wouldn&#39;t be a problem if you are store buying. Secondly ( and this is just for personal preference) I would maybe like it slight thicker, I love the combination of the crunchy crisp with a tiny bit of fudgy brownie and so if these were slightly thicker they would be ideal for me. But they are amazing anyways and I would definitely purchase in the future!\n",
  "These were seriously delicious and such a delight...I ate them all within 24 hours of opening the bag. The brownie flavor is spot on and it really does taste like you&#39;re eating the yummy crispy edges of brownies! I am in love!\n",
  "Brownie Brittle was very tasty. My whole family devoured the bag in seconds. The crisps are light as air, but have that dark chocolate brownie taste that we all love.  I would buy this product to throw in lunch boxes or keep in a desk at work for a quick treat.\n",
  "Overall good flavor.  It is very very chocolately so to me it was a bit too much chocolate.  But it did serve its purpuse full filling my sweet tooth without filling up on food that was full of fat and sugar.  I probably would purchase again but only if on sale and with a coupon.\n",
  "I was really excited when I received my free samples of the Chocolate Brownie Brittle. I really liked the crunchiness of it and that the ingredients were all natural too. My kids also enjoyed it as well. I I will definitely buy this if sold in a store. I recommend this product !\n",
  "Really tasty! Wish most of the pieces were bigger but other then that it was very yummy. Will be buying them when I find them at the grocery store.",
  "Think I found the best snack ever! I really thought they were going to be flaky and taste fake but it wasnt they taste just like brownies but just in a bag. ",
  "so i got my brownie brittle and they sent 2 bags.(yay!) i did think because of the name that it would be like butter brittle but brownie flavored. this was not the case but it didnt matter. it was alot like the description says..the crunchy edges of a brownie. i liked it alot and ate the whole bag in one sitting lol. i would recommend it to anyone\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle sample I received through Swaggable was unique and delicious, and I hope to buy a bag of the Salted Caramel Brownie Brittle next. Having read the description, I still expected these to taste more like cookies than brownies, but no... these actually taste just like the crispy edges of a delicious brownie, with soft chocolate chips baked in. I think this product could have been a touch less sweet, but otherwise I&#39;m a happy camper.\n",
  "The Brownie Brittle snack was amazing!!! I wish I had more right now!!! So crispy and chocolatey!!!",
  "OMG! I couldn&#39;t wait to write the review for this! I loved this so much! It came on the perfect day, too, right before my son&#39;s baseball tournament so I had a little snack of my own to take along. It really melts right in your mouth. My only complaint was that the chocolate chips weren&#39;t spread evenly so it was hit or miss if you&#39;d get a lot of chocolate chips in each piece. \n",
  "So delicious!! I hd to hide this from my boys. Sweet and light and so full of chocolate! And not hard like true brittle, this eats more like a cookie!\n",
  "I absolutely LOVED the brownie brittle! Brownies are my favorite desert and this encompasses the best part of the brownie, the hard part. YUMMY! I just wish I had icecream to top it with, it would have been perfect. A great treat. \n",
  "We were pleasantly surprised by this product. I thought that the brownie brittle might be dry, but it manages to be rich and crispy at the same time. The cocoa flavor is intense (in a good way), and the studding of chocolate chips was much appreciated. My husband says that the brittle  reminds him of his favorite part of traditional brownies -- the crispy corners. We&#39;ll definitely be buying this product in the future.\n",
  "Best stuff ever invented . I tried to keep the bag to myself but it was inpossible . My husband snatched it up like no tommorrow and said now he found something so tasty for a snack . We LOVE LOVE this brownie brittle and will be Customers for life. The rich Chocolate taste and the great crunch you get makes this a amazing product . Thumbs up \n",
  "These bad boys were awesome ! I was a little nervous about trying them but man there GOOD ! Once my 4 year old son got his hands on them it was over.  Ate the whole bag.  ( well what was left !)",
  "Well, butter my biscuit - these were AMAZING. Prior to tasting to these I had only heard GREAT things and so I was not worried about whether not I&#39;d like these or not. After all, I have a huge sweet tooth and Chocolate Chip and Brownie were in the name.  Normally, I like my sweet treats to be soft but being brittle it was only appropriate that it was crunchy! I would certainly purchase these again and would love to see what other flavors they hvave (after googling found 3 others: salted caramel, mint chocolate chip and toffee crunch)! I highly recommend them to anyone who loves a cookies & brownies, because really it&#39;s the perfect mix of the two! \n",
  "I was really skeptical if I would enjoy a brownie that wasnt chewy but I have to be honest, this Brownie Brittle was amazing! The chocolate flavor was incredibly rich and decadent and the chocolate chips added just the right amount of softness and velvety chocolate to the brittle. I have already purchased two more bags as its is now my favorite new snack! The snack sized bags are the perfect size and all of the brittle pieces were in perfect little squared- that werent broken either. I am a fan for life!  ",
  "These chocolate chip brownies take exactly like brownies, but with a little crunch, and the chocolate chips on top makes it even better. They are full of flavor, brownie lovers will love them. I love brownies & ice cream, so I tried them with vanilla ice cream & it was delicious. Try them!!!",
  "These were the best part of the brownie by far!  My 8 year old absolutely loved them and I loved them as well.  It is like getting a bag full of the crunchy outer edge of the brownies with chocolate chips scattered throughout them.  Well definitely be buying some soon!",
  "This was by FAR the BEST sample I was EVER offered. 2 Bags, both GREAT size and they taste AMAZING. I&#39;m hooked and I will be a customer for LIFE. Two thumbs up! \n",
  "OMG these were heavenly and everyone loved them. They are great sprinkled on top of ice cream or even just a snack alone. I can&#39;t wait to eat more. I definitely recommend the brownie brittle.\n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is so delicious that I have already bought more.  It&#39;s the best part of a brownie- the crispy part!  They are a yummy snack and are made with natural ingredients which makes me love them even more!\n",
  " I love the crispy ends to brownies so this was perfect!  It was a tad sweet for me but my kids and husband did enjoy as well. I would recommend to anyone looking for a sweet snack. Did love that it is certified kosher, made with natural ingredients and peanut-free. This snack was named a hot item for weight watchers so its great for an indulgence if your watching your calories. ",
  "I loved these! They weren&#39;t too chocolaty for me but it may just be me. All in all I really did enjoy them and when I got to the last broken pieces and crumbs in the bag, I poured them over vanilla ice cream and enjoyed it that way which may I add tasted divine!! These are a great go to snack if you have a sweet tooth and don&#39;t have much fat!\n",
  "If you are looking for a highly addictive, deliciously, crunch snack that satisfies your chocoate craving, then this product is for you. After indulging in this yummy treat, I fel full and satisified without any guilt. I felt this snack is light yet really made me full so I was not hungry for anything else after consuming.\n",
  "loved this product tasted great and even my kids loved it.\n",
  "I love this product! It tastes really, really good! Every piece had very visible pieces of chocolate. Lots of big pieces of brittle too. \n\nI would definitely buy this! Good stuff!! \n",
  "I thought these were amazing! They tasted so good. I loved the crispy crunch. My kids also loved them we ate the whole bag in 2 days! I would definitely recommend these and I will be purchasing more in the future! :)",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was better than I ever expected! First of all, the bag wasn&#39;t a sample. It was a generous sized bag. I have always loved the crispy edges of brownies and this is exactly what I needed! The best part? Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is made with all natural ingredients and it&#39;s actually low in fat and calories. 1 serving is only 120 calories! I have already told 5 friends about this incredible treat! I now have to try the Salted Caramel Brownie Brittle!\n",
  "WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE BROWNIE BRITTLE BUT IF WE HAD ONE COMPLAINT IT IS THAT HALF OF OUR BAG WAS CRUMBES, but they were delicious crumbs and are prefect to put into shakes or use as ice cream toppers. the bag was family sized and they were delicious i know if i see them in stores they will be in my cart and on their way to my cabinet!\n",
  "I loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. I was very surprised to see how much there was in the sample. Great snack! I have never tried something like this before. It was like a brownie flavored cookie. This is something I will definatly buy!\n\n \n",
  "I received these not long ago and was surprised it was a whole bag. I had never heard of them before and saw on the bag it is made with all natural ingriedients. These was super delcious and I couldn&#39;t stop eating them. Packed with a yummy chocolate flavor and a extra crispy crunch. I loved them and will be looking for them in stores!\n",
  "First off - what a generous sample! Immediately after opening the bag we were hit with the most DELICIOUS scent! It was so strong, like we were actually baking brownies. We took a few minutes to enjoy before scarfing down. Im not a big fan of the corner pieces when it comes to brownies, but I did thoroughly enjoy these. They were more like brownie chips - very thin and crispy. I loved the whole chocolate chips, too. Were definitely going to try the salted caramel variety.",
  "This product is soooo good!  I will be purchasing more.  The chocolate flavor is perfect and I love the crunch factor.  I would so reccommend this to everyone.  My son ate one bag by himself!  My boyfriend and I both thought it was so awesome!  Would be a great gift with some hot chocolate!\n",
  "Yummy and chocolatey! Tastes just like a brownie with a chip crunch! Highly recommend!",
  "Ya know how people fight over the edges and corners of the brownies, usually after hoping they&#39;ll be just a little bit crispier than they should be? Well, this is a bag of THAT! These things were SO good! My kids loved them and we didn&#39;t even have the mess of having to bake, to get straight to the best part! Best of all, the fact that they are also made with natural ingredients and are a low-cal indulgence, they are also healthier than baking a pan of brownies. Easier, quicker, AND healthier?!? Yes, please!\n\n \n\n:-)\n",
  "Love them! they taste just like homemade brownies and the crunch is an unexpected but welcomed and yummy twist. This is an entirely new idea and they were delicious.Will be purchasing more in the future!\n",
  "I received this upon return from a family trip and almost hid it so that I wouldn&#39;t have to share. I did the right thing and let my husband try it. He ate an entire bag in one sitting. He then demanded that I NEVER buy brownie brittle because the lack of self control he has around it is shameful. (I didn&#39;t tell him that you sent me 2 bags.)\n\nFast forward one week and I bring out the second bag to let the kids try it as well as sneak a bite myself. Good thing we opened it and doled out portions, because there was a little bit (1/2 the bag) leftover. It was crunchy, chocolately and if you love the outer edges of a brownie - pure heaven. Hubby discovered the remains of the bag - because it&#39;s empty shell was in the refuse bin the next morning.\n\nHubby thought they were a little too sweet, but he also ate 1.5 bags so take that with a grain of salt. The boys loved it and have asked for more. I thought they were a great crunchy and sweet snack. All of the best parts of a brownie without all of the mess to clean up!\n",
  "This was the best sample ive ever tried!! The brownie brittle is the best product invented!! I recommend the chocolate chip!! So delicious and full of flavor. I didnt want to share!!",
  "Delicious. Crunchy and crispy like a cracker yet sweet and chocolatey like a brownie. very good size bags.",
  "Are you kidding me?  This is the best brownie I&#39;ve ever tasted!!! When I thought brownie brittle  I was actually thinking it was going to break my teeth.  It didn&#39;t at all, it was the perfect crunch and SO much better than I expected.  I honestly wasn&#39;t too sure what to expect, but that first bite blew me away.  I couldn&#39;t stop eating it after.   I love the flavor of the chocolate and chocolate chips.  I like that they are smaller pieces and they all taste the same.  I find it very hard to believe that these are a WeightWatchers item or 120 calories because they taste SO good!!  I highly recommend trying these if you haven&#39;t already.  I love these and I&#39;ll be buying them again for sure!! \n",
  "I absolutely LOVED the brownie brittle. They were so delicious and weren&#39;t what I expected at all. I ecpected very hard, chewy brittle resembling peanut brittle. But this was nothing of the sort. It was even better!\n",
  "This is definitely a unique snack great for choc-o-holics like me!  It&#39;s a great substitute for a chocolate bar since you can really taste the chocolate chips in the crisp chip and it does remind me of the crunchy edges of a homemade brownie although I would miss the chewy parts of the brownies too.  This is a thin, light, crispy chip that has HUGE chocolate taste.  I&#39;m afraid I would eat the whole bag in one sitting though because it is so light.  I&#39;m definitely curious about the other flavors it comes in especially the Toffee Crunch flavor.  With only 120 calories per ounce and 4 servings for a bag I think you can get your money&#39;s worth, but I don&#39;t think I have seen them in stores so you would probably have to order them online.  I think these are perfect for the whole family to enjoy and great for when you might have company over or for a party.\n",
  "I loved this. It was delicious. I gave my kids and husband a piece to try, and they tried to take it all but I wouldnt let them. It was crunchy and tasted like the crunchy bits from a pan of brownies. ",
  "The Brownie Brittles were absolutely delicious. The brittles reflected a homemade brownie. I recommend that everyone goes out to buy Sheilas Brittles they are absolutely Amazing!!!",
  "my family and i love the brownie brittle. we are very excited to have found a place to buy it as well at costco :) at first i wasnt sure how i was going to like because i normally dont eat brittle but i love this brownie brittle tastes just like a brownie :)\n",
  "We enjoyed the brittle it reminded me of a gourmet oreo, I would like to note that one of the samples showed up with postage due $6.00 for anyone still waiting for their samples ...\n",
  "These were so delicious chocolately and crispy , i will be purchasing these in the future my Kids Loved them too \n",
  "These chocolate chip brownie brittle pieces pack a lot of brownie flavor however leave something to be desired.  They are light, airy, and crunchy but not the first thing I would choose to snack on when I was craving something sweet.  \n",
  "Oh my goodness!! Brownie Brittle is awesome!! Love the chocolatey taste and the awesome crunch! Everyone in my house enjoyed it and we are sad that it&#39;s all gone! Will definitely be buying more real soon! Love that it is made with natural ingredients and only has 120 calories per ounce, how great is that for a chocolatey snack? Yum!! \n",
  "This was really good think it would go great with milk or coffe. It taste rich and taste just like a fudge brownie but crispy.\n",
  "i love this its like heaven in a bag there great and you cant just eat one thank you , for letting me try this yum.\n",
  "I am so excited I got to sample the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle!! I couldn&#39;t stop eating them! The delicious chocolate flavor of both the brittle and the gooey chocolate chips was enough to leave me wanting more! I plan to go out and get some soon... I might just buy enough bags to tide me over for a while! Great product with an amazing flavor! \n",
  "The chocolate chip flavor was yummy, and tasted just like the brownie edges!  Based on the name alone, I was almost expecting them to be more like a chewy brittle (Like peanut brittle), but they are more like very light, crisp cookies.  I shared them with 3 friends (or I would have eaten them all!), and every one that tried them, liked them.  They were a nice addition to yogurt for a crunchy snack, and I bet they would great sprinkled over ice cream or yogurt. \n\nI would really like to try the flavored ones next!  In stores, I was able to locate them in my local Sam&#39;s Club!  \n",
  "These were so good! I&#39;ve bought more already. They taste exactly like brownies and I just can&#39;t get enough! I literally ate the whole bag the moment they arrived at my house.\n",
  "I&#39;m a lover of brownies and I had seen these in Costco, so when I got a double sample of these, I was excited to try them. I&#39;m more of a gooey brownie girl so I was disappointed that they were more like crisps. The idea of brittle elicits a dense rich flavor, and these... aren&#39;t that. Some pieces had a burnt aroma and flavor, and the bottom of the bag was very crumb heavy. They weren&#39;t the wow facter I was hoping for, but I am pleased that the chocolate chips in them were at least soft, large, and whole.\n",
  "Taste great love this product exactly like the corner of your brownies the nint is the greatest flavor ",
  "These are SOfrick&#39;n good, I&#39;m glad my kids found them and ate the rest because I had BIG plans lol! They&#39;re like brownie cookies - I love the edges of brownies - this was like a bag of edges big enough to fully enjoy. YUM is all I can say!\n",
  "This sample of bag of brownies are very delicious & my kids love them a lot.",
  "The taste was a bit too rich for me, so I let my children enjoy this snack. It&#39;s not that this snack isn&#39;t enjoyable, I&#39;m just not a big fan of rich chocolate flavor. My older children (6, 4, and 3) absolutely loved this snack. Definitely a  better snack alternative to some of the others out there, especially with all natural ingredients!\n",
  "It had a good taste, but it was too crunchy for me. I realize it being called brownie brittle I should have expected that. I actually thought it was going to be candy. Im not a fan of hard cookies.",
  "They were great.  The tasted really chocolatety and were crisp.  A good amount came in bag.  Would buy.! ",
  "I didnt know exactly what to expect when I received this package but I have to admit they were pretty good!! Pretty much like a brownie chip great for snacking full on chocolate flavor!!! I know the pointy is to be like a brittle My only suggestion would be to add a chewy texture dont even know if that is possible but still an amazing product!! ",
  "These tasted so good. I could not quit eating them. They were crisp like a chip with the taste of a brownie. They were so addicting. I can&#39;t wait to eat these again and try the other varieties. I would highly reccomend these to anyone.\n",
  "This hit the spot! Crunchy, chocolatey and best of all - pieces were still in good shape! Ive seen the bags all around the stores and now that I know theres mint chocolate chip...Im buying it! \nOh! And another great benefit - ingredients are in the healthier side - non chemically I mean ",
  "Swaggable sent me these Sheila Gs Brownie Brittle in Chocolate chip  complimentary for testing purposes. The entire family sat down and ate these in one sitting. They were Ah-maze-balls!!!!! I put them in the fridge to get cold first because I like my brownies either warm or really cold and crunchy and these were cold and crunchy. I could have eaten the whole bag myself but I decided to be nice and share! Haha. I havent seen them in stores yet but if anyone is looking to purchase these they are available for purchase on Swaggable last time I checked.  \nIf you love the crunchy ends of the brownie you are going to love these. Basically its a whole bag of that... Crunchy brownie end pieces! I will be buying these myself for when I need a chocolate fix!!",
  "I liked the brownie brittle it is like a crunchy brownie. It almost taste like a chocolate chip cookie but with more chocolate. I liked it and so did my family. If we were in the store we would buy a bag or two. I would recommend to buy this. \n",
  "I would have to say that for taste I give Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle an A+! I loved the crunchy texture and the chocolatey taste. It is a tiny bit messy though.. every time you take a bite crumbs scatter everywhere which makes cleanup a little annoying, but sooo worth it! I love that it has only 120 calories per ounce and I feel like it&#39;s a great snack not only for me but everyone in my family!\n",
  "The chocolate chip brownie brittle was by far amazing!!!! It tastes exactly like the corners of brownies and the bag didnt even last a day in my house. This will be a repurchase in my house! Hopefully sooner than later as soon as I can find somewhere to buy it. Thank you for te opportunity!",
  "I admittedly was unsure what to expect from these samples -- and what a sample they sent!  It was a full-size bag, so a decent amount of Brownie Brittle was there to be had.  Thank goodness, too, because the minute my husband and daughter discovered it, the brittle was gone!\n\nThe name could be misleading for some, because it definitely lacks the texture of peanut brittle or other similar brittles I&#39;ve had.  They&#39;re comparable to a thin cookie, like the corner of a brownie that&#39;s a little over-cooked and thus, crispy.  The texture is great, and my daughter loved the cookies that came from the bag.  They&#39;re light, so a quick bite or two could give me a nice chocolate fix without being too heavy for between meals. \n\nThe taste is rich and decadent and absolutely delicious.  I love chocolate, and these were very tasty!  My husband preferred them with milk, like a cookie, whereas my daughter and I were really enjoying them plain.  \n\nI am looking forward to using my coupon to try another flavor.  Thanks Swaggable!\n",
  "The Brownie brittle was pretty good. I liked the idea behind it, and I could definitley eat this, but I thought it tasted too much like burnt brownies. Not a strong burnt tasted, more like over cooked. Overall I think this was a fun snack and I am glad that I tried it!\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle was not what I expected it was very good and tasty didn&#39;t leave an aftertaste like I expected. My kids gobbled it down as well and both of them loved it! I like that you can go to Sam&#39;s Club and get it there and the price is very affordable ! I am def going to get this as a snack for my family to munch on!\n",
  "Awesome, yummy and chocolatey!  Great snack and dessert option.  Loved it!\n",
  "I was really not sure what to think of these tastey looking snacks when I recived them. The picture on the package looked really good and I loved how much was in it. When I picked it up it was heavy feeling for the size so I started to feel a bit better.\n\nThen I opened the bag and it smelled really good. I am a huge fan of crispy brownies so I figured this would be a good product to try. I&#39;m very happy to say that I was pleasently surprised that I finished the bag as quickly as I did. Yes I am implying that they were really good and I wanted more. I had another bag, but I really wanted to share that one, so I made myself stop eating and share the goodness!\n\nSo what exactly are these wonderful brownies they are brownie brittle, they are certified-Kosher, Peanut-free and are made with natural ingredients. They are also a weight watchers hot item, so yes they are good for you, well if you don&#39;t eat the whole bag at once they are, but hey sometimes you just love something!\n\nI would reccomend this to anyone who loves brownies and wants a healthier option to snack on. Even if your not looking for healthy these still are great snacks and you can always have them around... No Baking Required!\n",
  "OMG,I am in love! These were great. I am defenitely buying some more. I highly recommend these! \n",
  "This was better than I thought! They are amazing and very light but filling! My kids tried them and they love them too! Something I&#39;d like to try in the other flavors.\n",
  "My family and I loved the Brittle Sample (whihc turned out to be a full size!!) A healthier option than general snacks, with just the right crunch! My son took it to school in his lunch, and even appeased him! I will be purchsing that is for sure!\n",
  "These were a shocker. When I read that they were all natural and kosher I thought they would be disgusting. When I opend the bag, I was shocked. It smelt like someone had just made a huge batch of brownies. They tasted just the same too. I love the crunch and that they are natural.\n",
  "Those brownies was pretty good i would. Buy them at the supermarket ",
  "I was not sure what to expect when I heard the words brownie brittle, I was expecting a hard candy with brownie chunks I suppose. The brownie was flat and hard with chocolate chunks/chips in it. At first I really didn&#39;t care for the taste as the texture was crunchy which is nothing like a brownie. I admit I let them sit open for a day and when I went back, well let&#39;s just say YUMMY! They were then slightly soft and I enjoyed them so much more that I finished the bag. I would recommend these to a friend but I would tell them to expect the unexpected. Would I buy them?Honestly,iIt would depend on the price/ For the size that I got in the mail I would spend no more than a dollar, for a family size bag about $4. Bottom line I can see this become a new favorite for a lot of people because it is different than anything I ever tried\n",
  "These things are SOOO good! They really do taste just like brownies, but crunchy! They are the perfect size to satisfy a sweet tooth without feeling too guilty...But be warned: They are addictive! I would definitely buy these and highly recommend them! \n",
  "I got the brownie brittle to review. I really didn&#39;t care for it. It tasted like burnt brownies.\n",
  "Absolutley delight to eat. crunchy, sweet and hits the spot!\n",
  "I received a free sample of Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle from Swaggable in exchange for my honest review.\n\nI was so excited to try this product because I have been seeing it in the store and knew that I would love it since I love the edge pieces of brownies. This brownie brittle is crispy and chocolatey and the little chcocolate morsels on top add an extra  chocolate sweetness. It&#39;s an added bonus that it&#39;s made with natural ingredients. \n\nI love love love this stuff and if you love the crispy brownie edges, then you will love it too!\n",
  "My whole family LOVED these, from the littlest to the biggest! As soon as you open the bag, you get smacked in the face with the smell of rich chocolate. They are great sized pieces, not too much and not too little. Not that you want to stop eating them. Ever.\n\nThey are crunchy with a rich brownie taste. They taste just like the crisper edges of homemade goodies! The chocolate chips add a little extra something special to them. This bag did not last long at my house, and I think we will be buying more in the future. They are amazing!\n",
  "A couple of weeks ago, I recieved a sample package of Chocolatge Chip Brownie Brittle. I was skepikal about trying this new product but considering I like brownies and I like cookies, I figured might as well give it a shot. I opened the package and I loved the chocolate smell that was inside. Me and my two kids, whom are both very picky, grabbed a handful and tasted them. My 5 year old was thrilled! He couldn&#39;t get enough of the taste and the crunch and prceeded to grab another handful! My 8 year old liked the crunchy taste but she really didn&#39;t care for the chocolate chips on top. As for me, I liked the overall taste. The crunch factor was a little much for my personal liking but the fact that I was able to get the love of brownies in a cookie form, made me happy. Also, the fact that they are low in calories, made me okay that my kids ate so many!  I would reccomend this to friend and I would buy this again and try some different flavors.\n",
  "Just received the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle sample a week ago...thankfully they sent 2 samples because myu son saw them, opened one & swallowed it within a minute! Now he is a growing boy but I&#39;m not sure he tastes food, just shovels it in until he feels full enough, leaves crumbs, empty plates in the sink (at least he will put his dirty dishes & utensils in the sink) & then you won&#39;t see him in the kitchen again until he&#39;s hungry again, or one of his brothers or sisters is hungry & he goes in to investigate what they&#39;re eating in case he wants some. I asked him how he liked it..I ate it was all I got. I tried it a little later with my youngest daughter, my chocolate eating buddy & we really liked it! My only complaint is that I wish they had been bigger samples & MORE!! (ha ha) I can see why they were named the Best New Snack Product of the Year by the National Confectionary Sales Association. They were crunchy and just sweet enough, gave you that satisfaction you want when you&#39;re having a chocolate craving...it&#39;s a cookie, candy & ,brownie all in one. Believe it or not it&#39;s only 120 calories! Peanut free so no worries for the lunchroom, made with natural ingredients too! I have already told my friends about them - know my kids like them, & can&#39;t wait to get to the store & buy some more!\n",
  "The brittle is amazing the flavor is very savoring! I will be running out to the store to purchase more!",
  "I really liked these! They were surprisingly low fat, too! They reminded me of a better version of the 100 Cal Oreo crisps, but with chocolate chips baked in. I would totes buy these.",
  "This tasted amazing! It tastes exactly like it says it would. Rich chocolate chips with the brownie flavor. \n\nMy 5 year old and I couldn&#39;t stop eating it. Would definitely buy more of this\n",
  "This was the most amazing stuff I have ever ate! I tried it and I ended up eating the whole bag and not sharing! Then I ended up buying a bigger bag at Sam&#39;s Club! \n\nI think that everyone should try this one and it&#39;s AMAZING!!! Did I say AMAZING!! Yes I did!! Go and get ya a bigger bag and share with your family! \n",
  "These were AMAZING!  They are crispy, crunchy brounie crackers.  They have a rich chocolate flavor, complete with chocolate chips, and are only 120 calories/ounce.  The bonus is they are so indulgent you only need an ounce to satisfy the chocolate craving.  I will certainly be buying these in the future!  <3 them!!\n",
  "There is so much chocolately goodness with every crunchy bite! You get the best of both worlds - a chip and a brownie. Finish it off with an ice cold glass of your favorite milk and you&#39;ll be truly satisfied. I would recommend it to chocolate lovers all around! :)\n",
  "I was excited when I was chosen to try Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle! Of course like many people I love brownies, their one of my favorite treats and I do love the crunch edges to! So the idea of an entire bag of crunch edges that taste like a real brownie was really appealing to me. The first time I sampled this product I was hooked. I was surprised at the fact that it really did taste like the crunchy edges of a real brownie! I tried to make my bag last a few days but I am not ashamed to admit that it only took me a day and a half to eat the whole bag! I just couldn&#39;t stay out of it! I love this product and I defintiely would recommend it to others and I would buy it for sure! \n",
  "I really enjoyed the product. I didnt think I would enjoy a brownie like item that had crunch of a cookie but I loved it!!\n\nI cant wait to use the coupon to buy more!",
  "I abolutely love the brownie brittle!  It was so delicious and great to not only munch on but satisfy my chocolate cravings.  My only complaint is it is pretty crumbly.  I would buy this as a treat for myself.\n",
  "I recently received some Chocolate chip Brownie Brittle made by Sheila G to review and I have to tell you my husband says that they are the best thing he has ever had. You see my husband has never been the type to really like eating the whole brownie, he like to eat the edges which would work out for me since I do not like that part of the brownie any ways.\n\nHere is what Brownie Brittle is, it&#39;s a bag of the crispy crunchy edges of the brownie. It is only a 120 calories so it is perfect to have as a snack if you are trying to watch what you eat or simply just to eat because you want to too. These are good just by them selves or with a glass of milk too.\n\nBrownie Brittle comes in other delicious flavors too. These are definitely something that I will be purchasing for my family to have. If you want to find out more about Sheila G&#39;s and her products you can visit her site at browniebrittle.com. I can guarantee that you will love them just as much as we have.\n\nBrownie brittle is also peanut-free, certified-Kosher, made with natural ingredients and was named Best New Snack Product of the year by the National Confectionary Sales Association.\n\nI cant wait to try the other flavors too, I think I will also buy some extras to put into some gift basket for the upcoming holidays.\n",
  "Good clean snack. Love that it WW approved. Great tasting snack. My son ate the whole bag.",
  "Seriously delicious! The free sample also included a coupon, luckily these are stocked at my local Safeway.... Im going to buy them the next time I grocery shop.",
  "OMG! OMG! This is definitly the snack for both me and my family! Just the right amound of crunchiness, sweetness and the amount of chocolate chips were on point! My family and I had this snack along with a glass of cold milk and that just enhanced the taste of the product even more. I will definitly be purchasing this product and I highly recommend this product to anyone. I also was surprised at the size of the bag for a sample. To be honest, I was thinking it was going to be those itty bitty trial size bags that most companies mail out to you. Boy was I wrong!\n",
  "I have had brownie brittle before, but with this one packed full\nOf chocolate chips was a whole new level of delicious! Seriously, I got these out of the box and took a test bite...followed by half the pack before I even knew what I was doing. Very, very good stuff! ",
  "Omg.... I had no idea such an amazing snack exist!  Im already a fan of brownies and chocolate chip cookies...but to have both the chocolately brownie taste and the cookie crunch all in one, is amazing ! \n\nPackaging:  It doesnt immediately draw my attention. But once noticed its like a mystery waiting to be discovered.\n\nBrittle:  I admit, I was terrified of trying lol it doesnt look like anything I would normally eat.  My grandmother sampled the first bite. When I heard her crunch, I thought are those chips? When she ate another piece, I was convinced it was worth trying.  \n\nFinal Thoughts:  swaggable go and get it.. Its worth a try if you love chocolate and like trying new things.  Im headed out the door to grab a bag now!!! ",
  "Yummy goodness!  I loved the brownie brittle so much Ive purchased three more.  I think the salted caramel flavor is my favorite.  Everyone at work who likes chocolate loved the too!",
  "This was a nice big package and we loved it! It was incredibly delicious. I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to like it but I loved it. Just the right taste of chocolate - not too much, not too little and chips. It came in crispy pieces and it was addictive. I have to say that I would definitely buy these again and try all the flavors. But, the chocolate chip brownie brittle was delightully crunchy and yummy! These are hard to resist. So, why try? ;)\n",
  "This is so flavorful and gets the best part of the brownie to you in a bag! Great for a little snack or dessert, it really satisfies the craving for brownies without all of the work or the calories of a whole pan. ",
  "The brownie brittle was really really good.  It&#39;s what I would imagine brownies being if in more of a cookie form.  I ended up eating the entire bag in just 2 sittings, very addictive!  My only gripe would be that the bottom of the bag was full of just crumbs and dust!  I liked the bigger pieces and those went by fast because it seemed that everything had already broken down into brownie gravel.  I&#39;d be willing to compromise on the brittle texture if the taste remained the same.  Also, the bag opening is a bit small.  Sticking my hand in there to get the bottom of the bag pieces was a pain... and I have relatively small hands.\n",
  "I would definitely recommend this product. You get all the flavor of brownies without all the guilt. I liked the texture and the strong chocolate flavor. I would definitely buy this product. \n",
  "I received  Chocolate Chip Brownie Brtittle to sample for review purposes and to be honest wasn&#39;t expecting much as I&#39;m a huge brownie lover and thought the crunch factor would leave me disasstisfied.   To my surprise the crunchy brittle is absolutely delicious.  It satisifies my craving for chocolate without the guilt.   My son ended up taking a bag in his school lunch and sharing them with his friends. I was instructed to go buy more at the store.  They are a big hit with my family and I will be purchasing them the next time I go shopping.\n",
  "OMG these were fantastic.  A must have in the house at all time.  Great by its self or in cecream or as a cake topper. \n",
  "Received a sample of Sheila Gs brownie brittle and to my amazement it was delicious especially the Toffee Crunch flavor.  I even went out and bought other flavors, so far all of them are great.",
  "Great, tasty snack and a great alternative to Peanut Brittle.  I like the flavor a lot better\n",
  "These are awesome,my whole family enjoys them. The only problem is portion control\n",
  "Great chocolately snack, perfect to get in that chocolate fix that is sometimes just so necessary. Love the crunch, and the pieces of chocolate chips mixed in with the crispy wafers. I had to share with the kids, but there&#39;s plenty in the bag to share a bite or two with everyone. YUM!\n",
  "These were so good myself and my little ones just loved them.\n",
  "Everyone in my family LOVED the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle!  Especially my daughters.  The look on my 2 year old&#39;s face went from unsure to extatic the moment she tasted it.  My husband said it was like the crispy edges of a brownie, which is his favorite part.  My favorite part was the size of the sample!  Not just one cookie, but a whole bag.\n\nI suppose the only downside for me is that when I dropped one on the counter crumbs went everywhere.  But if you don&#39;t mind that, then it&#39;s not a big deal.  I definitely recommend this Brownie Brittle.\n",
  "our bag w as gone the very first day we got it in the mail. My family and i loved the flavor of it and will be purchasing it again soon to try the other flavors we saw online. \n",
  "If I see these in the store I will buy them. They had a cookie crunch and a nice chocolate flavor.\n",
  "I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of these.  My family did enjoy them though.  My kids and husband thought they went perfect with a glass of milk.  They loved that it was a brownie that was like a cookie.  Since brownies can&#39;t be dipped in milk, but cookies can be.  I know for myself, I liked that they were low calorie.  I had a friend try one, and that was a HUGE selling point for her, as she has been watching her calories.  \n\nWhen shopping, one thing we do look for is things that are all natural.  Brownie brittle does fit that.  \n",
  "These were a great, light snack. I loved the rich, deep chocolate taste and would definately buy them again!\n",
  "I absolutely love this brittle.  It is so chocolately and delicious.  This has to be the best product I have tried in a long time.  The problem is that you don&#39;t want to put the bag down!  I highly recommend this.\n",
  "OH My god.... I am in Love with Sheila G&#39;s chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle, i get bags out of shipping box... imediatley open a bag and smell inside the bag... oh smelled like heaven... took out one brownie square took my first bite.... so so good heavenly brownie taste, after that first bite i knew i was in love, thanks to sheila g&#39;s brownie bites i have a new addiction!!! Best snack i have ever tasted!!!\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was a huge hit in my house! Someone has finally taken the best part of a brownie (the crunchy edges) and put it in one delish package! The brownie brittle was perfectly sweet with real chocolate chips that you could actually see and the crunch was to die for! I can&#39;t wait to find this in my local super market, because I have to try it again!\n",
  "All my kids loved them they had great flavor and they are a great go to snack... I would buy these in a store for my family ",
  "I absolutely loved the Chocolate chip brownie brittle, it was sooo good! It is just like eating the corner of a brownie which is my favorite piece! My husband and I always fight over the corners haha, now we dont have to anymore! I will definitely be buying this product! Oh and thanks for the coupons!! Btw it was a sure hit with my two boys (1 and 4 yrs)! They were begging me for more after they were all gone! I give this snack 5 stars all around! ",
  "First of all, I love brownies, but not the crust. I wasnt sure if I would like this brittle. The answer is YES!! It was a cross between a brownie and a cookie. It was sweet enough to satisfy your sweet tooth without busting your waist line. They are only 120 calories per serving. Dont let the word brittle scare you. The brittle describes the shape of the pieces, random just like brittle. There was a down side though. There were a lot of leftover crumbs in the bottom of the bag but that was the only problem with Shelia Gs Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. Just be sure to buy two bags, one for you and one for your children. Mine ate these better than any cookie/brownie I have ever purchased or made!",
  "These were very good. I tried the chocolate chip, and it tasted just like the crunchy edges when you bake chocolate chip cookies.\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle was out of this world!! I have never tasted something so delicious in my life. It tasted just like a brownie but healthier and not even messy like a normal brownie would be. If you haven&#39;t tried it you must. It looks like a brownie tastes like one too!! The chocolate chips in it gives the brittle the most flavorful taste. My kids loved it so much we can&#39;t wait to buy some very soon.\n",
  "I was not expecting much. When my sample arrived I opened it and passed it around to the kids. We all bite into it and enjoyed it a lot! It tasted great! Just like the top of a brownie! We did agree that the chocolate chips in it get very hard though.\n",
  "This snack was simply DELICIOUS! It sounded good just by looking at the package and reading the description, but the taste by far exceeded how tasty I thought these chip-like brownie brittle pieces were! A new favourite snack of mine& my family.\n",
  "This product  surprised me at how fast it arrived, how Lovely it was packaged, and Delicious it was to \n\nmy tastebuds!!!  You get a Great amount with this sample-which I believe consumers LOVE. It actually made \n\nme want to view their website to find out more about this product...and I was thrilled to find out it comes in\n\nother flavors as well (WINNING!!!)  What are you waiting for? Put your mouth in a Great mood, and order \n\nthese now-your smile wont keep this one a secret.\n\nThank you Sooo much for sending me this Wonderful sample that I cant stop raving about. Continued \n\nSuccess & God Bless.\n",
  "This product is amazing. Great chocolate flavor and crunch. Most of the product was broken in the package and there were a lot of crumbs. I would love to try the other Flavors. I love that the product is low calorie.",
  "These are the ultimate fun snack!  Incredibly delicious and fun to eat!!  They are delicious!\n",
  "This product was a hit at our swag party 7 out of 10 said they would buy it.",
  "Good for snacking! The flavor is that of a normal brownie but the texture is that of a cookie or flat bread. Delicious and you can see the chocolate chips all over the pieces. It&#39;s a fun, delicious and different type of snack. Great with milk or by itself.\n",
  "Brownie Brittle turned out to be WAY better than I was expecting it to be. I was expecting something lacking flavor or something that was a little off. I was pleasently surprised to find that these were far more delicious than I was expecting however. I tried them by themselves, and I even tried them with peanut butter... and they were absolutely scrumptious both ways. The flavor reminds me of cocoa pebbles, which is a huge plus in my book (seeing as I always loved that cereal). My point is however, that these are well worth the purchase and since they are made with all natural ingredients, they aren&#39;t too bad for you either. I give them two thumbs up!!!\n",
  "This was so good. By far the best brownie brittle out there on the market. The whole bag was gone in less than a day. I will be buying more of this for sure.Thank-you for the brownie brittle.\n",
  "My husband and kids loved the intense chocolaty and cookie crunchiness of the Brownie Brittle ! I liked how the brittle was in bite size pieces for small mouths or could be eaten by the handful by the big guys during the games. This will be a product that I will keep in my snack bag at all times.\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is awesome! It is perfect when you want a little chocolate taste, but don&#39;t want to have a whole dessert. The flavor is indulgent without breaking the calorie bank. I liked the crunch, too, perfect for dunking in milk or merlot. :)\n",
  "This product lives up to its claims. As soon as I opened the bag, my nose was assulted with a delicious brownie smell. The brittle is a sort of cross between a crispy cookie and a brownie. The ONLY reason I wouldn&#39;t purchse this item is because I might eat the entire bag, it&#39;s that good. :)\n",
  "My family and I loved this! It was sweet, chocolaty, and crunchy!! We ate it as a snack and also made cupcakes and topped them off with the brownie brittle! \n",
  "Great Snack for a brownie lover such as I, I enjoyed the crunchines, great amount for on the go snacking or a lunch bag treat, also good for kids with  fruit after school a perfect treat for popcorn on movie nite \n",
  "I gave these to my kids to try because I do not eat wheat and try to limit my sugar. They both really liked this product. My son, age 14, said that they were good but he couldn&#39;t see us buying them. He could have eaten more than one bag. It took my daughter, age 17, a little longer to finish her little bag. \n\nThe kids described these as brownies that were spread very very thin in the pan before being baked. They had chocolate &#39;chunks&#39; (probably chips). My daughter says they were very good (yummy!). They weren&#39;t too crisp. \n\nThey seem like they&#39;d be a good little snack for when driving or watching a movie. I don&#39;t think I would buy these unless someone specifically asked for them. And I would want a bigger bag ;)\n",
  "Jason got a hold of my bag, and ate them all up! I luckily did get to try them, and they are so yummy! We got the Chocolate Chip kind, but there are other flavors! A good snack for when you are craving something sweet.\n",
  "Delicious!  It is as it claims - the flavor of a brownie with the crunch of a thin crispy cookie. I am eager to try the other flavors. The only suggestion I have is to improve the packaging- the mailed sample had a considerable amount of crumbs. But I truly appreciated the full sized sample!\n",
  "I am sooo in love with Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle that I wish I had an endless supply. From the crunchy brownie flavor that really tastes like the corner of the batch to the mini chocolate chips. The chocolate was the perfect sweetness, and the thin waffer was just right on the crunch. The bag was full too! Usually you buy a bagged product and a lot of it is air. Not this one. You really get a full bag, but it leaves you wanting more!! I will definately be watching for these and want to try the other flavors. I have told everyone to look for them and carry the little card with me so they see what product I am talking about. Not to mention they are a hot item for those on Weight Watchers.\n",
  "This is a great way to enjoy brownies and still control your portions! Tastes just like a brownie! Too bad I ate the whole bag in one sitting! I couldn&#39;t put it down.\n",
  "I love the taste, it is so rich and buttery. I like the presentation very much too, I wish they would sell them in more places. Great product, highly recommended.  ",
  "This is a very tasty cross between a cookie and a candy.  It&#39;s a great snack, and it makes a wonderful topping for ice cream crumbled over a sundae.  My husband really enjoyed finding them in his lunchbox and has already asked for more!\n",
  "Love the CRISPY gourmet brownie !!! When you bite the crispy intensifies the taste of brownie and chocolate. Very good ingredients too !!! I read the history behind them and really like it...\n",
  "These were pretty tasty and satisfied my sweet tooth.  I love the corner brownies, so this was a treat for me!  I would love to try the other flavors now!\n",
  "I lived this product !!! I armed the whole bag in two days!! Perfect bite size pieces, great amount of chocolate in each piece and smells like heaven when you open the bag!!! ",
  "really really tastie . would definitely purchase this item\n",
  "This was a tasty treat! We try to make better food choices in our house, and these were a better choice than some. The taste was spot on chocolate awesome, and the crunch was addicting!\n\nThe packaging was great too, becuase you could snack a little, then reseal for next time!\n\n \n",
  "I am a huge brownie fan so when I got these, I was excited to try them.  They exceeded my expectations.  All the flavor of a brownie, without a lot of the calories.  Plus, the crunchiness makes these more intriguing than an ordinary brownie.  5 stars!\n",
  "OMGosh!!!! So Yummy, I will be buying more soon.\n",
  "OMG!!!!! these are soooooo good a brownie  with a cookie crunchy tasty my kids love them i couldn&#39;t get rid of them until the hole bag was gone  i will be buying more \n",
  "I had the chocolate chip. It was bitter chocolate which is not my favorite. Maybe I would enjoy another flavor more.",
  "Brownie Brittlr is dealious. I have even bought some with my coupon.\n",
  "I love these! Ive tried cookie crisps/brittles by another company before and those were good but these brownie ones are amazing and chocolates. They will definitely be in my rotation!",
  "These Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle snacks were delicious! I nearly ate the whole bag the first time I tried them! They were so hard to put down. The crispiness combined with the chocolate chips were a delicious combo. I appreciate that they were made with natural ingredients. The one thing I missed was the actual chewy brownie. I kind of wanted some chewy brownie pieces included. Maybe they could make something like that, a combination of the brittle and brownies. Despite that, I would definitely search for them to purchase again. They were so good and really satisfied my sweet tooth!\n",
  "Omg these were amazing. I love having these for an endulgent snack. 120 calories per ounce is awesome! They are crunchy and chocolatey. My two favorite things! Get them, you wont regret it!",
  "This was outrageous! I loved it! it was all about the crunch factor, but that little hint of chewiness that is the best part of brownies. I really liked that the flavor was true to a traditional brownie and that the pieces were generous ( not these itty bitty crumbs on the bottom of the bag).  Although, it brags only 120kcal/oz, i really think it would be rare for some one to be able to each just one ounce! I think I ate about half the bag myself! I am glad I got to try this because I will definetly be buying this and sharing with  my freinds!\n",
  "LIKE IT , GREAT SIZE. TASTE ALSO GREAT. \n",
  "These are so yummy! You get the yummy chocolate goodness of a brownie with the crisps of a cookie. I really enjoyed them & So did everyone who tried them! Really great snack to satisfy your sweet tooth. I will be purchasing these again! I also got a whole bag to try which was a great surprise I only excepted a little sample package!\n",
  "These were so different, but in a fantastic way!! The whole family loved them! Great flavor and texture!!",
  "I truely enojoyed the brownie brittle. I was afraid at first that it would be too hard but it was the perfect texture. They tasted DELICIOUS!!!",
  "I did not love these. I was intrigued to get in on this sampling but when I opened the bag most of the pieces were broken and the bottom 1/4 of the bag was brownie dust. There was a strong brownie flavor that was mildly satisfying, but not really on the same level as a brownie. I ate a couple with a cup of coffee, only because the bag was sitting on the table. I&#39;d rather have one really good brownie than a whole case full of these. They were mediocre at best. meh.\n",
  "They tasted really good and they are great for on the go snacking, but I still prefer a regular brownie over dried pieces of one.",
  "Omg. These are soooo yummy!! My 2 year old and I totally ate a whole bag in one sitting!! ",
  "not very good, but some of my family members enjoyed it, too hard for my taste.\n",
  "My whole family liked it. I wasnt so sure about it a brownie brittle until I opened the bag. Once open it smelled just like homemade brownies. The bag was gone immediately. I would buy this product .",
  "Though I love the texture of a good chewy brownie, the flavor of the brownie brittle is just right! Not too sweet and sugary, great chocolate flavor and the best thing is that when youre done it doesnt leave you feeling stuffed and heavy. So all in all its a great snack for when youre craving a brownie but dont want something too filling. Would love to try the other flavors!",
  "I couldnt really enjoy them due to the wheat ingredient and my mom said that they were very rich in taste.",
  "These were delicious. Sure they are a little artificial, but the texture and flavor were crispy an chocolatey. I would recommend this to anyone who like brownies, but does not want to make them. I would buy this if I had someone to share with.\n",
  "I admit that Im a chocoholic, so I was excited to try these (especially because I have seen them in the store).\n\n At first, I was disappointed because they are not ” brittle” like say peanut brittle. They are more like little brownie crisps.\n\nThat being said, these are delicious. Each piece had a few chocolate chips in it, which made it even better. These were just the right chocolate/richness combo for each piece.\n\nThey really are like light little brownie crisps. Very true brownie flavor. The bags were decent sizes too.\n\nI am looking forward to trying some other flavors!",
  "I would recommend brownie brittle! When I received it, I didn&#39;t know what to expect, but once I opened the packaged and realized what it was I decided it is a great concept. It tastes great, my favorite part is the chocolate chips. What a tasty snack or dessert!\n",
  "The brownies were actually better than I thought they would be. A little too crispy for me but my husband loved them and wanted more! I liked that there was two bags and not just enough for one bite like most trials are. I would recommend the brownie brittle and would buy them for my family.",
  "I really did like them. I would recommend them. Thay are good with milk.",
  "This stuff ROCKS! WOw! When I got the box, I was so excited to see what it could be! Did I order anything? No. Must be from Swaggable, but what is it???? OMG, the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. I&#39;ve had a compairrable kind from Costco, but this is much better. More flavor to it. The crunch was delicate, it didn&#39;t hurt you to crunch into it. Ya know what I mean. Sometimes you bit something that&#39;s too hard, and then all you can think of is that it&#39;s going to break a tooth it&#39;s so rock hard. But not this. I immediatly went to their facebook page and let them know how much I love this product. I&#39;m a fan, and I told all my 5,000 facebook friends how much I love it too!!! \n",
  "I Loved these....my kid&#39;s how~ever loved them much more lol...I got 2 out of the whole thing and my kid&#39;s ate the rest!! I thought they we&#39;re fun size and soooo tasty!!\n",
  "These tasted SO good! Crunchy, but not a burnt flavor like can happen when making brownies and pulling edges.  The only problem I had, was that they crumble so much. By the time you get to the bottom of the bag, its just powder. A LOT of powder, but just powder.",
  "I was more than surprised to get  two bags, The moment that I opened the bag the aroma smelled so good like warm brownies, which more than likely was due to the fact that it was a warm day when they were delivered.. But none the less they still were very mouth watering and enjoyed by my whole family, this is one product that  I know that I will buy more of. Once both bags were depleted I used the coupon to purchase more. They are delightfully delicious and was pleased with the over all flavor, texture and taste.  Thank you for sending me delightful goodies.. \n",
  "My favorite sample to try thus far! Awesome chocolate taste left me wanting more! I felt like I was indulging but I know I was consuming less calories than if I was eating a full brownie.\n",
  "I was pretty pumped to try these, especially since it was my first Swaggable free item. However, I wasn&#39;t really that impressed with them. I would compare them to chocolate teddy bears. Also, they claim only 120 calories...yeah, per serving. In the personal bag there are at least 2-3 servings (technically) but I could easily eat the whole bag...and then my healthy snack really wasn&#39;t that healthy. I was telling my Mom about them and she agreed that they reminded her of chocolate graham crackers. It&#39;s a neat idea, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d bother buying them from the store. Sorry to be a Debbie Downer!\n",
  "So good! It was like eating the crispy edges of the brownie. I had it with milk at first, and after I miraculously didn&#39;t eat the whole bag, I tried it coffee too. How is this Weight Waters friendly and Natural too? I would have never guessed. It&#39;s a satisfying chocolately cookie. I will definitely buy the other flavors.\n",
  "I was pleasantly surprised by the brownie brittle. It really DOES taste like a brownie, but has the crunch of a cookie. I was expecting it to be much harder than it was, as my experience with brittles were that they were always hard to chew. The brownie brittle wasn&#39;t hard to chew at all and almost melts in your mouth. This is a great snack to curve the chocolate cravings.\n",
  "There crunchy and just ugh love them they have alot of chocolate and the sample was a nice size I was surprised my sister liked them too the bag didnt last long I will be buying these again ",
  "I was so excited to be chosen for this sample! I was surprised to see a full sized bag in the mail and I tore into it immediatly. So good! I love chocolate and these were perfect! Great with a glass of milk. I love the crunch to them, like nothing I&#39;ve ever had. I will absolutly pick these up when I see them in stores.\n",
  "I received the Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle (chocolate chip brownie flavor0for review from Swagable and it was awesome! How did I not kow this exsisted? seriously it is crispy brownies (thing crispy like a chip but all brownie!) Not that anything will keep me from these in the future but if I was one to let calories stand between me and m chocolate fix it would be helpful to know that these are only 120 calories an ounce and weight watchers even calls it the hot snack item of the year.\nThe only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 was honestly their advertising was TOO good... I wanted the toffee flavor that I read about (toffee is my FAVORITE anything) so I had a cravoing for toffee while eating these...now that being said I thought thisese were incrediable, I would totally buy them AND I am planning on getting the toffee kind too!\n",
  "I received the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle to sample and honestly wasnt impressed! My one and only bag come smashed but I sampled it regardless :(  It seemed to have ok flavor but was so very dry it made my mouth pucker up! \n",
  "I loved Sheila G. Brownie Brittle..my favorite part of a brownie is the corner piece because of the crunchy edges...this was like having all edges...I hope to see this in my local stores so I can buy more...if not I guess Ill be online shopping!!!",
  "Divine!  I will definitely be buying more!\n",
  "I really didn&#39;t think that it was going to be that good because of it being chripy but when i tasted it it was like fire works in my mouth... i think that i will but a bundle of it for christmas and give them away as gifts.\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was so good my family was even fighting over the crums. If you like the corner peices of the brownie you will love the chocolate chip brownie brittle it is just crunchy enough and rich enough. A perfict treat for anyone and a product I would love to find in the stores so I could buy a lot more. I didn&#39;t even feel guilty for eating the chocolate chip brownie brittle because its only 120 calories per ounce which is better than most brownie mixes. I would highly recomend this product especally someone with a sweet tooth.\n",
  "My kids loved this so much. I love that it tasted just like you was eathing the edges of the brownie. \n",
  "I had been wanting to try this. All I can say is YUMMY!!!",
  "I really enjoyed the brownie brittle. I think the brittle is very different and something out the box. I shared my sample with friends and family. Everyone including myself will be purchasing the product very soon.",
  "I was so excited to get these. I mean who doesn&#39;t love brownies and cookies! Why not have them in one. So they smell great! They taste like a brownie. The texture is well lacking. If you like the edges of the brownies when you overcook them then the brownie brittle is for you. I am not knocking them at all but they are only for a select few people. I also think they could do without the chocolate chips. I think I will try they other flavors they might be a little more to my liking. \n",
  "I absolutely loved the brownie brittle! I have never had this type of snack before. It was delicious! It was crunchy like a cookie, but chewy like a brownie. I was happy with the nutrition facts as well, as they were pretty low in fat. I would definitely buy these again if they were sold in stores near me (no stores near me sell it, sadly). Expaning the stores that carry Shelia G&#39;s Brownie Brittle would be awesome! I liked that a coupon was included even though I can&#39;t use it. I would highly recommend this snack to anyone who loves brownies and chocolate!\n",
  "OMG I absolutely loved these chocolate chip cookies! Very thin and crispy but had a real homemade chocolate chip taste. Perfect for snacing any time and hits the spot for a chocolatey fix! I loooooooved these cooies!! <3<3<3\n",
  "Oh my goodness - I was so excited to try this - it was amazing :)  I opened this as soon as it came because I am a huge chocolate and a huge brownie fan.  The yumminess started as soon as I opened the bag.  It smelled like I had just baked the brownies in my oven and my mouth started watering!!   The pieces are mostly square and even after shipping they were mostly whole - I had a small one first and nearly died!!!  It was amazing, like the crispy brownie edge all the way through.  They were not like the burnt edges but just the crispy yummy goodness edges.  The little chocolate chips inbedded are amazing.  I had to stop myself after three squares or I would have eaten the whole bag.  I let them sit for another day or two before trying again - they were even better the second time!!!  I ate every crumb (not kidding!!!) and will be buying this as soon as I can find it somewhere.   Great chocolate and brownie craving food!!  You could easily eat these like potato chips and devour a whole bag in one sitting!  \n\n \n\nThanks for letting me try these via swaggable :)\n",
  "Very crispy and rich enough to only need a few small pieces at a time. Also, the calorie count is pretty low for a sweet (which is surprising for as rich and chocolatey as it is). I would recommend this to anyone who likes chocolate, sweet/crunchy snacks and anyone who wants a treat but is watching their calorie count. I will definitely buy this if I see it in stores!\n",
  "This is a great product!  The flavor is amazing and I really look forward to trying the other flavors.  It is amazing how close they taste like the yummy, crispy edges of the brownies!  Great taste without the guilt of eating the whole brownie, but very satisfying!\n",
  "This was absolutely yummy! My husband and I fought over them! I dont really have a sweet tooth but these were very good that i couldnt pass them up! Will definitely be buying these! Thank you! ",
  "So yummy! Crunchy cookie chips, almost - thin sheets of brownie with chocolate chips, these are an awesome snack for a sweet tooth or to satisfy the need to crunch. Also awesome crumbled over ice cream!\n",
  "Absolutly delicious!! the flavor is amazing and they totally capture the best part of any brownie; the crispy edges! tihs is officaly my new favorite snack!\n",
  "Delicious!!! Was so very excited to get these in the mail. 2 bags might I add... I had tasted them and loved them. Crunchy and light. Chocolate chips in the brownie brittle. Perfect for that chocolate fix you may be craving...140 cal per serving/2 servings per bag....good size servings.  Both my boys had tried the and also loved them. They agreed with me when I stated the tasted like the crunchy eds of a brownie...2 THUMBS UP!!\n",
  "These were absolutely delicious! I was fighting everyone off to have the whole bag to myself! while I did share, I found it difficult, since these were the perfect mix of brownie and cookie. Loved them, and am actively looking for them where i shop.\n",
  "I thought it had a good taste, but I am not sure if I like the texture of being a dry, crisp brownie.  I like to have a brownie soft and chewy, but my son who is almost three, loved them.\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was fun to eat. I liked the rich chocolate flavor. They tasted really good with coffee. If you are looking for a crunchy, chocolaty snack then this is what you are looking for. I dont know if this is something I will crave or not but they are good. My kids liked them also. If they asked for them I would get them. They did taste like the package said they would. Like the crunchy edge of a brownie.",
  "the chocolate chip brownie brittle is so good\n\nmy husband and I love it..thanks so much\n\nill by it in the grocery when im going.. \n",
  "Well my husband thinks I&#39;m crazy.  I didn&#39;t absolutely love these.  I do like brownies, but I think the best part of eating a brownie is the warm soft gooey goodness that comes from the middle pieces.  These are the parts around the edges that are cooked to a crisp.  Either way, the flavor is great, and they have the chocolate chips which always makes things better.  My husband, on the other hand, thinks this snack is the bee&#39;s knees.  Nearly wrestling me to the ground to get his hands on it (it was a rather large package for a sample, so I&#39;m not sure why he was so anxious) and waiting impatiently as I had my first tast, he couldn&#39;t wait to get into the bag.  I suppose having this snack on hand would be great for those who get the occasional craving for a brownie, without having to make an entire pan (and then devour it in one sitting).  \n",
  "I got this sample in the mail about a week ago and my husband and I each had a bag and it was amazing we dont really buy things like this on line but we are going to try when our next paycheck comes because it was so good Thank you so much for letting us try this amazingly great product\n",
  "These were AMAZING! They were not too sweet, but yet chocolatey crisps. I liked that they were so light that I could eat the whole bag and not feel guilty!!!!\n",
  "Delicious! They were like eating all the yummy, crunchy edges on a brownie. I loved them and so did my nephew. I almost didnt share them. ",
  "These tasted very good, and I loved the idea of brownies that are quite like peanut brittle.\n",
  "This was delicious! I took it to work with me, and everyone was intrigued, and then amazed at how good it was. I am determined to find it around me!\n",
  "These were soooo good. They tasted exactly as a brownie should. I was worried they wouldnt be that good but I was surprised it was like eating a chocolate chip brownie cookie. My kids loved them and we have already bought more.",
  "Best brownies I ever tasted. I dont like chocolate what so ever bit these were so delicious.  I thought Oh maybe they will taste a  bit burnt.  they didnt.  I was surprisingly shocked but these deserve 5 stars.",
  "This was delish! I normally dont like the corners of brownies and when I read about this I thought this would not be for me bit I loved it! It was so crisp and tasty. More like a thin cookie. Would definitely buy this! ",
  "Chocolate chip brownie brittle is amazing! If you love the crispy edges of brownies these are for you! Not too sweet and just the right amount of chocolate flavor. I am excited to try the other flavors of brownie brittle! If you like trying interesting things then I highly recommend these.",
  "This Brownie Brittle tasted just like brownies, and I cant think of anything I have tried like this. I would purchase for a treat for myself or a friend.",
  "Yummy! I love them. They taste just like brownies. The crispyness is perfect, not too hard. I&#39;ll be keeping an eye out for these.\n",
  "these are the greatest snacks i have ever tasted in my life. \n\nupon recieving these i thought they were going to be like every other &#39;brownie-like&#39; snack and be filled with aspartame, sour, bitter, nothing i would want. BUT i opened them, gave one to my son and i took one and we tried it together. \n\nmy eyes lit up, my mouth was satisfied. not only are they delicoius, they are not messy and they are super fabulous! they were such a hit, my kids and i walked to the grocery store and bought 3 bags. i give them a few pieces after dinner every night.\n\nthey are sweet, savory, cruncy and addicitng. omg. super happy. super excited i recieved this! this was super wonderful!\n",
  "These were Awesome!!! They are very tasty and an easy on the go snack. My kids even loved them. This is a product Im going to have on hand alot!!  ",
  "Hi. My husband and I found these to be too sugary. We like sweets... esp husband. But we could almost feel grains of sugar which we did not like. Flavor is ok and I suppose sort of fun.",
  "I did not like these as I am not a brownie lover. Unique product if you like brownies.\n",
  "Oh my!!! These are SO dangerous! It was very easy to open the bag and not stop untill they were gone! I took them to work so as to prevent myself from maybe eating all of them as I thought I might. From the time we opened them to maybe 30 minutes later we were all just in brownie heaven! And we didn&#39;t even have milk!\n\nMy only sugestion, bigger bags!\n",
  "I was very excited about trying this product, and I was very pleased by it. I&#39;m savoring every chewy, chocolate-filled bite. It looks somewhat like a cookie, flat, but tastes just like a delicious brownie.  I really can&#39;t complain. I like that it is somewhat healthy (I mean, come on, it&#39;s chocolate), and made with natural ingredients.  I&#39;m definitely trying the mint version next time I see it at the grocery store. Yum!!\n",
  "Love these so much. Taste delicious, just like brownies. Very crispy, very chocolately, overall excellent. Would buy and recommend",
  "Havent recieved this product yet cannot review. Im sure this is a great product and it will probably end up coming tmw or the next day.",
  "Omg these are so good. A must buy, love the idea of a chocalte chip brownie cookie and it taste just like what it is... perfect for a snack while watching a movie or on the go... and its all natural. I just bought some more at BJ&#39;s Thank you \n",
  "I LOOOOVVVEEE CHOCOLATE and Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle™ snacks did NOT disappoint!   Thanks to @Swaggable, I received two (2) FREE bags of Sheila G&#39;sChocolate Chip Brownie Brittle and I will definitely be getting more!! They are delicious! Each piece of brittle is crispy and crunchy ..with just the right amount of sweetness. If that wasn&#39;t enough..get this... 1 oz is only 100 calories! FANTASTIC!! \n\nMy only slight concern, the amount of chocolate chips varied greatly from one bg to the other...I only wish each bag had lots of chocolate chips, my 2nd bag was lacking the chippies... Still.. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n",
  "So, I have to give it to Brownie Brittle, for coming up with such a simple yet innovative idea in dessert snacks  Most people would admit that there&#39;s nothing better than the taste of homemade brownies just baked.  But, the problem is that not everyone has the time to bake an hour to get the homemade taste of brownies.  That&#39;s where Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle comes in.  The crispy yet flavorful pieces of brownie in a brittle form are quite the addictive snack.  I confess, I finished the whole pack in less than a day or two.  I love the fact that they are crunchy, because it totally satisfies my craving for a snack with crunch.  Another plus, is the fact that they are made with natural ingredients.  I&#39;m not surprised that it received the Best New Snack Product of the Year,  and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree if you try it too.  The only downside?  When you are left with an empty pouch.  I haven&#39;t seen them in the grocery yet, but I would definitely purchase it if they were sold at a store near me.  \n",
  "I would definitely recommend Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle to anyone.  These are so tasty and the fact that they were considered a hot item by Weight Watchers is just an added bonus.  I can&#39;t believe they are only 120 calories per ounce.  It is very hard to find delicious prodcuts that are peanut-free today but Sheila G has really nailed it with this product.  This is like pieces of crispy chocolate brownies baked with chocolate chips - it doesn&#39;t get any better than that for a delicios healthy treat!\n",
  "The chocolate chip brownie brittle was good my kids and I enjoyed them, I wish I could have saved them so that I could try them in other ways instead of just eating them straight out of the bag. Id like to try them again and also the other flavor varieties. ",
  "These were really terrible. Brownie Brittle is not for me. The texture was really hard and they tasted burnt. No amount of milk could have softened these. The picture makes them look like they would be tasty but they are not. These are one of the worst snacks I have tried in a long time.\n",
  "I thought It was a great product, a little different. Butonce youve eaten a couple you get used to the light airy crunch, and it really does taste like brownie. My finace loved it so did my kiddos, even went out a bought a bag. I would really reccommend this product to my friends, family, or really anyone tha ti know\n",
  "First let me say that the corner brownies are always my favorite and I have always fought over them. I lvoe the crsipy edges and that&#39;s what I loved about Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. The pieces tasted just like brownies with chocoate chip pieces but they were all crunchy like the corner pieces. The chocolate taste was not overpowering and the crunchy pieces were not so hard that you felt like you were breaking your teeth. They are weight watchers friendly which makes them a delicious snack for the whole family that you can feel good about eating. My entire family loved them and they will now become a staple in my house.\n",
  "I really enjoyed the chocolate chip brownie brittle.  Perhaps it should come in a box instead of a bag, however--there seemed to be a LOT of crumbs at the bottom...but I ate those too.  I was afraid the brittle would be very sticky, and stick to my teeth, but it wasn&#39;t.  Best new product I&#39;ve had in quite awhile, and I plan on using the coupon that was included and buying more.  :)\n",
  "Click here for my Video Review of Brownie Brittle\n\nhttp://dafreebies.blogspot.com/2013/10/brownie-brittle-review-for-swaggable.html\n",
  "I received my sample odSheila G&#39;s brownie brittle and fell in love. They are amazing! If you love the edges of a brownie you will love these! They are sweet, crunchy a tad salty everything you would want in a good snack all rolled into one!\n",
  "I could probably eat my weight in these things, and I&#39;m typically not a big fan of sweets.  They also scored big points with my teenage son, who is incredibly conscientious about what he&#39;s consuming.  I&#39;ll be buying this product, for sure.\n",
  "I like no I LOVE this product!!!!  I like how they made this like a brownie but like a brittle.\n\nI was thinking it was going to be too hard to eat because it be tough but it wasnt.\n\nLove the idea adding chocolate chips.  That enhanced the taste of it.\n\nI would definitely buy this product once it hit the store shelf.\n\n \n",
  "My kids loved this! They ate it up and wanted more. Interestingly enough, we are usually a gooey, middle of the pan brownie family. This was a great snack though and my children will be sure we buy it next time we&#39;re at the store.\n",
  "It was really good, a little sharp it cut the roof of my mouth up. Overall really good though.",
  "These Brownie&#39;s were great!  I loved the taste.  My kids loved them and sometimes they can be picky.  They have a crunch to them, but very yummy!  Would recommend! \n",
  "I thought that brownie brittle sounded wierd when I first heard it, but this is so good. I crumbled mine and used it as a cake topping. I would definately reccomend this to friends and will definately buy it in the future!\n",
  "This stuff was awesome, nice and crunchy and just the right amount of chocolate. Although it reminded me more of a really crunchy cookie than a brownie.\n",
  "i loved this product. wish it was on shelves in my area so i could go and pick up a few bags. tastes so good. real chocolate chips in every piece. the bag was empty way too soon.\n",
  "I really liked the crisp crunchiness of Chocolate Chip Brwonie Brittle, but was a little disappointed in the taste. The chocolate taste seemed a little fake to me, with an aftertaste that I really could have done without. However, it does give you a chocolate fix without a bunch of calories! Great snack to grab and go, but I wish it didn;t leave the aftertaste!\n",
  "Brownie Brittle by Sheila G&#39;s is like eating the best part of a brownie with every bite - the crunchy edges! They are like a thin brownie-battered cookie. I was especially impressed that they are a hot item by Weight Watchers! There are pieces in the bag that are big and small and 1 oz is 100 calories. It definitely satisfies that sweet tooth. It&#39;s a different snack for people tired of the same old thing. My kids loved having a small piece with an ice cold glass of milk. \n",
  "I was weary of the idea of brownie brittle actually tasting like a brownie but I was pleasantly surprised at just how brownie-like they were! The taste was phenomenal and I enjoyed how light they were versus eating a normal brownie. I wish I could have eaten more but my husband devoured the bag! I will definitely purchase these.\n",
  "I guess I&#39;m actually one of the weirdos who likes gooey brownies better, so I tried Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle with some preconceived notions about whether or not I would like it.  I was pleasantly surprised to say that I did.  The brittle has a rich, extremely chocolaty taste that is very much like a real pan of brownies.  A couple of small pieces was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.  While the double chocolate was almost too rich for me, I would be open to trying other flavors, such as Toffee Brittle.\n",
  "I love this product!! I&#39;ve been looking for it in stores but can&#39;t find it.I&#39;m having brownie brittle withdrawals lol.Like the packaging,and the flavor was excellent.Will buy in the future.\n",
  "These are by far the best! I love that each piece really does taste like it&#39;s the corner of the baking pan. Tastes just like brownies and sharable as well. Great product. I would recommend trying the mint chocolate ones those are awesome.  I tend to take the crums and put them in a small glass of milk and enjoy.\n",
  "I must say that I am very impressed with Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle, when I received my package from Swaggable I tore into it right away, as I consider myself a brownie conniseur of sorts. I have to say that I was blown away! The crisp crunch was wonderful, and chocolatey flavor was divine, I loved the smattering of chocolate chip throughout the pieces of brittle that gave it a creamy richness. Another thing that I loved was the fat and calories factor, they were relativly low for a chocolate cookie type product , I think around 4g for 3 pieces ( I don&#39;t have the bag now, as it was gone in about 2 days lol ), but I am thinking that this may be my go to product when I am cravign brownies, as I am trying to lose weight at the moment. \n\nI would definitely recommend Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle to anyone looking for a great chocolatey, crisp snack. And I wil be fnding the nearest place to purchase it again!!!\n",
  "These brownie bites were absolutely delicious!! My kids and I enjoyed them so much! I was actually quite sad when I found myself at the bottom of the bag. They had such an incredibly crunchy chocolate-y taste it was really like eating my favorite part of a brownie at all times!\n",
  "When I first opened Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle I couln&#39;t put it down.The flavor is very geniune tastes just like those awesome corner peices of freshed baked brownies. Its firm but not hard that you can&#39;t eat it. Great for a late night snack or when you have guests over. \n",
  "Love Love Love this! I already puchased two bags at my local Sam&#39;s Club and I sent a bag to my sister in California via Amazon. I only wish the sea salt flavor had more availability. This is my favorite new snack product in years. It&#39;s so crunch and just the right sweetness. I already recommended the product on my facebook page as soon as I tried it.\n",
  "Um, I really wanted to lie and say I hadn&#39;t received my sample simply to receive another one, but I can&#39;t.  This was, for lack of a better word, FANTASTIC! Crispy, chocolatey, sweet, but without being over the top.  The best part was that even if I did eat the entire bag myself (which I, sadly, did not), I would not have felt too guilty.  It was the perfect blend of sweet and crunch.\n",
  "I love brownie brittle thank you so much! I love the crispy edges and the melt in your mouth irresistible chocolately brownie flavor. This is so unbelievably tasty at 120 calories a serving. However, I find it hard to eat just one serving. This definitely a must try product.\n",
  "OMG! I was so surprised at how much I loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle.  Delicious, crispy, sweet, chocolatey..........but not a heavy snack.  I shared some with my guy (not that there was much left when he got home from work) and he was surprised at how good they were too.  Just the name alone gets ones attention.\n",
  "Brownie Brittle is like chocolate crack.  I just couldn&#39;t get enough.  I love that they&#39;re crunchy, but at the same time rich and delicious.  I founf myself hiding from my preschooler just so I wouldn&#39;t have to share with him.\n",
  "i love this! it is so delicious! i am a brownie fanatic, and this tasted exactly like the crunchy ends! The crispy texture and the fact that it melts in your mouth makes them highly addictive. i am so getting more!\n",
  "I am a admitted snacker. I love to snack on mostly unhealthy snacks, that&#39;s why I was so excited to try the Shelia G&#39;s Brownie Brittle. Being a fan of both Brownies and Brittle I knew this was going to be a product that I would love. I love the fact that it is only 10 calories so I don&#39;t have to worry about my diet being ruined and I also love the fact that they are made with natural ingredients.If you are looking for a snack that satifies without the guilt, Brownie Brittle is the one.\n \n",
  "This was so delicious. My only issue was most of my package was crumbs but we just used them as a topping on some ice cream and drizzle with chocolate so it worked out perfectly. I would definitely buy these. ",
  "Honestly, I normally don&#39;t like brittle, but I love Brownies so I was nervous and excited to try this product.  I&#39;m so happy I did.  The brittle was not sticky like I imagined it would be.  It was almost like a Brownie cracker.  Delicious, crisp and flavorful.  It satisfied my chocolate and my crunch craving in one bite!\n",
  "I don&#39;t normally like the edges of bronies(I like the center pieces the best) but these are SOOO good. Nice and crisp and chocolatey. What an amazing idea.\n",
  "So this is pretty much amazing, it came in the mail and my dad came by I opened it up and let him try it, lets just say I got a crumb to taste myself. He gobbled the entire bag up before I could blink my eyes. These are super tasty and unlike traditional brittle do not get stuck in your teeth. I highly recommend them! As does my dad apparently.\n",
  "I am in kove with this snack just like brownies and brittle together but with no mess. ",
  "When I received my Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle I could not resist the urge to open it up and give it a try right now. OH my goodness, it is DELICIOUS! I definitely recommend these to all! Love it!\n",
  "i was a bit skeptical about the product at first, because to be honest I hate the crunchy parts of the brownie, but after trying the Brittle, it had a great taste, and was very unique. I would reccomend this product to anyone who is looking for something unique, fun, and delicious. \n",
  "We got our brittle and my husband went right to town on them. In my head they looked like they would be really rich and then something I wouldn&#39;t care for but after he tried them and said they were not that rich I tried them and thought they were good.  I liked the crunch and they will make a great snack when I need a little pick me up but they are probably not something that I will be craving all the time.\n",
  "I was so excited to receive the boxes of Brownie Brittle at my door step. At first, I wasn&#39;t sure I would like these because I&#39;m not a fan of peanut brittle. It&#39;s too hard and crunchy for my taste. However, the brownie brittle was such a pleasant surprise. It had the consistency of a cracker but somehow also had all the taste of a delicious, chocolate chip brownie. It was really good -- my entire family enjoyed them. I would certainly recommend these to everyone I know for a sweet snack. I notice that the product has won some awards and I can see why -- it&#39;s delicious and also very unique!\n",
  "This sample showed up at JUST the right time of the month (if you know what I mean)!  It took every ounce of willpower I had to nibble a few pieces here and there...it&#39;s DELICIOUS!  I even let my hubby try some!  All future Brownie Brittle will be stashed away as this low(-ish) calorie snack is perfect for alittle taste of chocolatey brownie goodness!\n",
  "I WANT MORE! This brownie brittle is amazing! I don&#39;t feel like i&#39;m cheating and my sweet tooth is totally satisfied! I recommend this to EVERYONE. Oh you must try it. BONUS Brownie Brittle snacks are peanut-free, certified-Kosher, made with natural ingredients. The best of both worlds.\n",
  "I wasn&#39;t too sure how much I would like the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. I love chocolate chip anything, and i love brownies, but I wasn&#39;t sure how the texture would be. Well, the brittle is AMAZING. it&#39;s absolutely delicious. It&#39;s thin and crispy and crunchy, but it breaks very easily, so it&#39;s not too hard. The taste and flavor are great. I will be buying this again. I haven&#39;t found it in stores yet but I will order online if I have to! Get a bag of this for yourself, trust me!\n",
  "I&#39;ve never been one for the edges of a batch of brownies. I prefer the chewy middle. But I loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. It had the perfect brownie flavor, and a satisfying crunch. They really didn&#39;t last very long! I know I&#39;ll be getting more soon. And I think anyone who likes brownies would love them as much as I did!\n",
  "I prefer underbaked, but my family likes baked. Sometimes I win, but sometimes they do.. Who wants a dry, stale, hard brownies? Not me! And at the bottom of the bag is enough brownie shake to top a cake!!!! but these are good for kids as long as u dont mind brownie crumbles EVERYWHERE. but they are pretty tasty\n",
  "Wasnt too crazy about this product... It came all broken and it was more browny powder than brittle.. But it was pretty good on vanilla ice cream",
  "I have been a fan of Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle and was so excited to get this in the mail.  Delicious and yummy.  I am a sucker for crispy edges of brownies... and this satisfies those cravings.  In our house, my sons love to crumble it up and put it over ice cream.  What I truly love about it is that it is only 120 calories/ounce and peanut free.  It&#39;s easy to take with you since it comes with a resealable pouch and it is such a delectable snack - how can you resist?\n",
  "I have never had anything like this! I love how chocolately it is and that it is crunchy.I dont think it is too sweet but it is soo good! Made a great late night snack.\n",
  "I&#39;m a big fan of brownie brittle and Sheila G&#39;s is some of the best I&#39;ve had.  They&#39;re tasty, light, and crunchy and go perfectly with cold milk or hot coffee.  Tip: You know those tiny broken bits in the bottom of your bag?  Sprinkle them on ice cream.  Yum.\n",
  "Brownie&#39;s are my Very Favorite indulgence.  I love them So So very much!!!  So, when I saw that there was a chance to try the Brownie Brittle snacks I crossed my fingers!!!  But then I saw it...named as a hot item by Weight Watchers?  Peanut-free and certified-Kosher?  And...made with natural ingredients???  I really wasn&#39;t sure if these would taste anywhere near as good as I&#39;d been hoping.\n\nThey arrived while I was on vacation and I didn&#39;t open them the first night I was home...or the first day.  But after staring at them that whole day I figured, well, they Need to be sampled, let&#39;s give them a try...\n\n And...oh my.  Oh heavens.  So So So good!!!!!!  You know how the corner pieces of brownies get a little crunchy and brittle?  That&#39;s Exactly what these taste like, just flat!!  They are, in a word, amazing. I&#39;m having to ration them for fear of eating the entire bag in 5 minutes!!!!\n",
  "That brownie brittle was so good that I ate the whole bag lol. I shared with family and friends but I didnt want to. I just need to know where to buy it! ",
  "The crispy edge of a fresh pan of brownies is my very favorite part! So it was like this product was made for me. I loved the texture of the brownie brittle. It was crispy and light. The flavor was perfect, like a brownie with nice big chocolate chips sprinkled throughout it. I would recommend these to anyone who likes the crunchy edge of brownies, and anyone who enjoys a good chocolatey crispy treat.",
  "This is a great product!! I loved the crispiness and yummy sweet chocolate taste. I would definitely buy this again. I shared mine with my kids, my sister and my husband. We all loved it! It was gone that night. Great with milk or coffee...or just alone as a sweet crispy snack!\n",
  "I&#39;m not a big fan of chocolate so I had a small bite of these, I&#39;m still not a fan.  My 4 year old on the other hand loved them.  She said they were very chocolaty and kept asking for more.  I thought they were too chocolaty for my taste.  Also, when I think of brownie, I think soft and chewy.  These were really crunchy.  At least they are all natural and low on calories which makes me feel less guilty when letting my kids snack on these.\n",
  "i absolutely love this product and have bought more.  i love how it is almost like a thin cookie.  not only did i love it but my children loved it also.  thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this product because i wouldnt have known about it otherwise.\n",
  "My niece LOVED the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. I love how it was thin and not too sweet for each serving. It satisfied my sweet cravings without overloading me in the sweet department. =) This is something I would definitely get in the future.\n",
  "I didn&#39;t know what to expect. But when I got it and opened up the bag a sweet goodness array of smells assualted my nose. Whats funny is, when I pulled out the thin peices of the brownie brittle I realized it was just brownie that had been cooked really thin to make extra crispy. I (soooo wrongly) thought it would probably taste burnt and nasty., BOY WAS I WRONG! (Take a pic mom, you won&#39;;t hear me admit THAT too often!) I ate almost the whole bag in one sitting and it was gone by the next day! PLUS + I have seen/noticed this product in Cracker Barrel since, and I nromally wouldnt have - so samplings do work!!!\n",
  "It was okay, not fantastic and I probably wouldn&#39;t get it again. I may recommend it to friends that like Brittle, but nothing more.\n\n \n\n \n",
  "These are okay.  Personally, my favorite thing about brownies is the ooey gooey center or chewy edges.  But these are like chips.  They satisfy one&#39;s crunchy craving but don&#39;t satisfy you if you&#39;re looking for something more indulgent and rich.\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is amazing. It taste like a cookie but with a brownie flavor. Everyone in the household enjoyed it and craved for more. Defiantly going to buy some.\n",
  "I&#39;m not usually a fan of crunchy cookies, but I have to say that these were pretty tasty. For those that like something a little crunchy with their coffee and tea I will reccomend these. But, if you are more of a milk and cookies kind of person you might want to look elsewhere. I would buy these just because I&#39;m a coffee and tea drinker. I especially like that these are good for the person trying to be health conscious.\n",
  "love it! the flovor is perfert! everything taste sooooo good! i am definetly buying some for the holidays for our xmas party!! i had never tried them till now and now they are my favorite! recomend it to the cookie and chocolate lovers!!!!\n",
  "I have to say that Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was a hit in our house! My husband loves the corner pieces of brownies and this reminded him of that. I thought it was a really fun, tasty treat that satisfied my chocolate cravings. I will be adding brownie brittle to my grocery list and I am looking forward to trying the other flavors!",
  "I had the pleasure of sampling Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle for free. I am one of those people who enjoy the crunchy parts of brownies and really enjoyed having whole squares of it from the bag. The snack is crunch but it also melts a bit in your mouth. Yum! The only problem I had with the product is how it crumbles to easy and the bottom of the bag is filled with small crumbs instead of squares. I will purchase this. \n",
  "my whole family came down the day that this came. they all tried it and loves it my kids wanted more and more. taste very good.\n",
  "I must say that this Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was quite good.  You have all the crunch of a cracker or crispy cookie and all the flavor of a rich brownie.  I like the smaller bite-sized pieces which allow you to get that rich chocolatey flavor you are craving without eating a ton of calories all at once.  I also liked how they are made with natural ingredients and are only 120 calories per serving.  Looking forward to trying the other flavors.\n",
  "They were wonderful, the only issue was that there were not enough. Loved that they were different, not a cookie, not a brownie, but all of the great flavor!\n",
  "I thought the brownie brittle swaggable sent me would be crunchy but it wasnt hard on my teeth. The taste was amazing, no bad after taste, my son and nephew loved them, we even ate the crumbs we will def be buying these on our next grocery trip !!

  "These snacks rock.  I love the edges of brownies and this is like eating the best part of the brownie without having to make a whole pan. They are so good with nice size pieces of chocolate in them.  It is very hard to eat just once piece. They were gone before I knew it. I recommend these to anyone who wants a snack without all the calories. Very indulgent. \n",

  "Delicious so good and I love the crunch.  I shared with my husband and he said he loved it.  It was a great treat. Thank you so much for sending me the brownie brittle.  I&#39;m a chocolate lover for sure. ♥\n",
  "When I first saw the package, I was a little intimidatd by the title of the product.  Brownie Brittle brought to mind thoughts of peanut brittle and pralines, neither of which I am a fan of.  I opened the package with a bit of hesitation.  To my delight, after biting into the first piece, I found I absolutely loved the product!  It tastes exactly like the crunchy part of a homemade brownie.  My coworkers all tried the brownie brittle, too, and even people who weren&#39;t brownie addicts like me approved!  I would highly recommend brownie brittle to my friends and family if they enjoy brownies!\n",
  "These things were so good! I had never heard of the company before and I was amazed at how delicious they were. They didnt leave a funny after taste like some snacks can. I would recommend these too anyone. My kids tried then too and both of them loved them.",
  "I gave the product 5 stars in all catagories because the flavor was of one of a regular brownie, the crispy-ness gave it a nice crunch and I was able to top my icecream off with it. I will be heading to SAMs Club to purchase 16 oz bag. Thanks for the sample. My girls and I really enjoyed it.",
  "This is pure GENIUS!! Any time we make brownies, the edge is the first to go and this is a bag full of deliciousness! We tried the chocolate-chip and it was great. Everyone in the house loved it and I will absolutely be purchasing this for a snack on the go.\n",
  "I love love loved this product!!! It tasted just like homemade brownies with a crunch.It really satisfied my craving for something sweet. I would definitely buy this product but I have never seen in any of the stores in my area.\n",
  "Wow, is all I have to say about this brownie brittle.  I dont&#39; know about you, but I love the burnt crispy edges of brownies.  There is something about the crispy bites that make the brownie more enjoyable.  And, while I can&#39;t burnt an entire pan of brownies just to get crispy edges, I can pick up a bag of Choc. Chip brownie brittle by Sheila G&#39;s to enjoy.  Every bite is crisp and full of flavor.  And at only 120 calories a serving, I don&#39;t have to worry about slipping up on a diet, and an even overindulgence. :-)  Would highly recommend this brownie brittle to brownie fans, chocolate lovers, or those with a sweet tooth.\n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie brittle was AMAZING! It was like cheating with none of the guilt!! It tastes exactly like the crunchy corner of fresh baked brownies and smells delicious also. My family fought over the last few crumbs and we are now on a mission to find and purchase vast quantities. At this point, I have not found it locally, so I&#39;m not sure on a price, but will contiue to look. It is also very porable and easy to eat...one suggestion is to not forget your glass of milk! My favorite product review by far!!\n",
  "This is a great product! It has the perfect brownie taste and the crunchiness of a cookie.\n\nThis was fun for the kids to try too :) I wish it was around when I was a kid.\n",
  "Im not a huge chocolate fan but I thought this chocolate chip brownie brittle was pretty awesome! It had a good taste and had a rich enough flavor to keep me from eating the whole bag at once :) also not too messy to easy. Im definitely going to buy this if I see it in stores!",
  "My husband and I absolutely loved this Brownie Brittle! It was really delicious and we finished the bag in no time! The only negative thing about it is that we can&#39;t seem to find it in any stores around us!\n",
  "Omg! These taste so good, I couldn&#39;t put the bag down! My kids love them too. I&#39;m very glad these are made with natural ingredients. I have recommended these to everyone I know, because they taste too good. \n",
  "Me and my family absolutely loved these!  In fact, we were fighting over the bag.  They are so nice and crispy and satisfy the crunch factor while totally satisfying your need for chocolate.  I can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors.  Absolutely delicious with a glass of milk!\n",
  "Thank you to Swaggagle for sending me Brownie Brittle snacks to try free. My kids and I enjoyed them so much. The brownies were thin like a chip but it pack a lot of flavor like you were eating an actual brownie. I would definitly buy this the next time I want a delicious snack.\n",

  "This stuff was really delicious! At first we were not sure how it would taste but everyone in the family loved it especially the husband! I would definitely buy this in the future it was a tasty snack or dessert that everyone liked very much! It was crispy and crunchy with really good chocolate flavor. They were kind of like chips that were made of chocolate.\n",
  "Addicting!!!  I was really surprised by the taste of the Brownie Brittle!  For being only 120 calories, it was extremely flavorful.  The crunch was just right too.  Hard to believe that it is made with only natural ingredients.  I would recommend this to anyone that has a sweet tooth!  In the afternoons I usually crave something sweet and the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is perfect!  Just a little bit takes care of the craving.  I recommend it for everyone to try!\n",
  "The brownie brittle was actually pretty good!! I love the edges of brownies so this was so perfect for me. The texture and taste was out of this world. Highly recommend!!\n",
  "I REALLY LIKED Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle, IT WAS CRUNCHIE LIKE A COOKIE BUT WITH A BROWNIE FLAVOR. MY SON LOVED THEM TOO.\n",
  "I was so excited when I got Brownie Brittle in the mail. I&#39;ve seen this in the store but was afraid to buy because I didn&#39;t want to spend $7 for a product that may be so-so.\n\nWell I really enjoyed the brownie brittle. It is just as it says...very thin & crispy brownie. Imagine some of the batter spilled on a cookie sheet as it baked....\n\nMy only complaints with the brownie brittle are:\n\n1) the product was very broken up when it got to me, and I imagine it would be the same with the bags you buy in the store. Easily 1/3 of the package was just crumbs at the bottom. Still good, and I am ashamed to list all things I sprinkled the crumbs on. However, I wish there wasn&#39;t as much crumbing (?)\n\n2) I wish the package size was larger. My husband and I went through the bag in 2 days just eating 1 or 2 peices each at a time. \n\nBut the taste was great! I really liked it. Please make the packaging better so less get broken and increase the package size\n\n \n",
  "I loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle sample.  It was a real treat and light snack.  I enjoyed every bite I took and would reccommend this to my family and friends. \n",
  "The Chocloate Chip Brownie Brittle by Sheila G was awesome. It reminded me of the crispy corner pieces. It even tastes just like the crispy corner peices of homemade brownies. These were so tasty I even let the kids try it and they devoured them. This is also a great alternative to actual brownies because there is way less fat and calories. I cant wait to try the other varieties.\n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is amazing.  Tastes delicious and smells yummy!  It&#39;s like having a whole bag of the crispy edges of a brownie...The best part!!  I can&#39;t wait to use the coupon and buy a different flavor!\n",
  "I loved it I would recommend it to anyone and I will be going out to buy some more next time im ar at the s store th thanks a bunch",
  "I am pretty picky about brownies. I prefer dense, rich flavor. I was concerned that this product was going to be simply a gimmick. Wow, was I wrong. I can&#39;t believe how rich and deep chocolately these taste, despite being thin. It&#39;s like eating the crispy top of a brownie, only firm and crunchy. It&#39;s like the perfect edge of crust along the metal pan. Only a whole bag full. The only bad thing I can dredge up about this product is that it sheds crumbs constantly. Really, it&#39;s well worth it!\n",
  "I loved the brownie brittle. The ends of the brownies are my favorite part, so it was awesome to have basically a bad full of end pieces. The chocolate chips added was just the right amount of sweetness. Definetly will buy!\n",
  "This was a very great tasting treat. I like it was different a brownie yet crunchy i would repurchase this again.",
  "Sheila Gs Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is full of chocolate flavor. The light, crisp texture of the Brownie Brittle is reminiscent of the edges of a pan of fresh-baked brownies. This snack is perfect for anyone who wants a chocolate fix, but doesnt want the mess and inconvenience of baking brownies. I would recommend Sheila Gs Brownie Brittle to any chocolate and brownie lover.",
  "Oh man...  Brownie Brittle snacks by Sheila G.! These tiny delicious squares are delish! Brownie Brittle is peanut-free, certified-Kosher, made with natural ingredients, and were named Best New Snack Product of the year.  Weight Watchers welcome with only 120 calories/ounce! I highly recommend buying and trying! I tried the chocolate chip brownie brittle and my favorite part is that I don&#39;t have to fight my husband and kids for the corner piece anymore. :) Can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors!\n",
  "ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! i COULDN&#39;T GET ENOUGH AND I COULD NOT STOP EATING THEM. i WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THESE TO MY FRIENDS!! THE HAD A VERY GOOD CHOCOLATE FLAVOR AND CRUNCHY. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING SWEET AND CRUNCHY THIS IS IT :)\n",
  "We really liked these. They were different than anything else we had ever tried. Fun and different and taste great.\n",
  "Amazingly good! They really are cool..when you first put them in your mouth you a familiar flavor of cocoa puffs touches our tongue, then they turn into something that tastes very creamy and chocolaty, but not overly sweet at all.I can’t explain it, but with each piece a new flavorful experience came, each time, getting better. I am not normally one to buy anything like this, but after trying, I would allow myself a splurge once in a while. You will not eat the bag in one sitting, not because they are bad, but because each piece is actually satisfying! \n",
  "Crispy fun to eat brownie brittle with great flavor and they aren&#39;t bad for you either!\n",
  "Wow i gotta say this brownie brittle stuff was so good i recommend it to everyone it had a nice flavor not too sweet nor too hard it was perfect. This sample i did like alot it was great and tastes good with milk, if they ever repeat this product again and send the samples again i would be so happy because i loved it so much..Thanks for this product it was very yummy.\n",
  "This stuff is awesome! I SO didnt want to share lol, but i was nice and and shared a few with my kids. I will definately be finding out where to buy some more!\n",
  "My entire family LOVED these brownie bites.  The only complaint I have is the amount of product in the bag for the price.  We enjoyed them so much that I searched online to purchase them, but could not justify the pricetag for brownies,  :(\n",
  "The taste wasn&#39;t bad but it was a bit too crunchy for my liking. It&#39;s like they sucked the life out of a brownie. If you&#39;re a fan of biscotti, then you&#39;ll probably like this, but it&#39;s not for me.\n",
  "I liked this chocolate chip brownie brittle! They have the flavor of brownies, but crispier!",
  "Sheila G.&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle snacks are pretty awesome.  Not totally awesome because I am a middle of the brownie pan person.  I  was hoping it would taste sweeter or richer than they did.  \n\nHowever, the people I shared my samples from Swaggable with loved them.  They loved the crispiness to it and felt the flavor was just right.\n\nThis is a product that I know will be purchased in the future for my household.\n",
  "My family is in love with this brownie brittle!!  We faught over the bag!!  Thank you soooo much Swaggable for letting me in on this!\n",
  "I&#39;ve actually had Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittles before so when I saw that I was selected to try them I was very excited. They do indeed taste like the leftover brownie bits after you finished baking them. Thin and light, the brittle wasn&#39;t greasy and didn&#39;t leave any residue on my fingers. I was surprised the sample box contained two bags of the product which I happily shared with family. Will definitely buy this when I see it at the store! And will keep singing praises to friends.\n",
  "I was very excited to try the brownie brittle. I opened it immediately after it came in the mail. I wasnt disappointed! Such a great chocolate flavor in a crunchy snack. As delicious as it was, I didnt get the brownie feel from it. There was no rich gooey ness in the product and that made it quite dry. Still delicious nonetheless. It put me in the mind of biscotti rather than brownies. ",
  "We received the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle in a rather generous 4oz bag. It was hands-down, without a doubt, FABULOUS. My kids were in love from first bite, and I have to admit, even though I don&#39;t much like chocolate, I&#39;m hooked. It&#39;s sweet, but not too sweet. Crisp, but not peanut brittle hard-as-a-rock. It sort of has a melt-in-you-mouth factor in that it dissolves down wonderfully & smoothly. It&#39;s pretty indulgent without any kind of heavyness to it at all. Careful, though, you could definitely demolish a whole bag of it in one sitting!\n",
  "These little brownie bites were just crunchy enough to satisfy my daughters after school craving,while giving me a low calorie snack with chocolate chips. They were plenty to go around,yum!!",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was delicious! I&#39;m a huge fan of the edges of brownies, and these tasted just like that. They&#39;re a perfect snack for when you&#39;re craving chocolate and want something low calorie at the same time. I highly recommend this product and would definitely buy them!\n",
  "It&#39;s a brownie, but it&#39;s not a brownie, it&#39;s a cracker! I loved it. It was perfectly sweet, with just the right amount of chocolate flavor and crunch. Plus, it is low in calories!\n",
  "Addicting! I opened my sample from Swaggable and could not stop eating these. I must admit, they dont look all that appetizing. They taste delicious though. I will definitely be trying more of the available favors! Yummy!",
  "wow!!! this  brownie brittle is amazingly awesome! i loved it!  they didnt last very long in my house, but at least i did get to try them.  i went back to get another piece the next day and the bag was empty. my husband had eaten what was left in  the bag. he said where did you get these? and can we get more?!! we will definitely be buying this in the near future. so, if you love or even like the edges of brownies, i suggest that you go try these asap! they are awesome! you will go back for more!!! not to mention that they are kosher and made with natural ingredients. love it!!\n",
  "I am not one who likes brittle. I do; however, love brownies, so when I had the chance to try Sheila G&#39;s chocolate chip brownie brittle I was delighted! I wasnt sure what exactly to suspect, but they are phenominal. I have recomended them to everyone I know. They taste nothing like brittle, but instead the crunchy end peices of a brownie, which just happens to be my favorite part of a brownie. They are easy to take along anywhere and there is no baking required! LOVE LOVE LOVE\n",
  "I loved the smell of sweet chocolate when opening the bag, The brittle was nice evenly shaped, and crisp! The taste was not overly chocolately but very delicious. I found I couldn&#39;t eat the entire bag and shared and we both raved at the taste. \n\nI would definately buy again. \n",
  "I liked the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle , its fun to be able to have a brownie in a chip shape the flavor its ok . For me its quite to strong but it tastes good . I like the fact that I can carry the bag with me in my own purse at any time .\n",
  "This product tasted really good. I love the crispy crunchy edges of a brownie. I love the fact that this product is only 120 calories per ounce and is made with natural ingredients.\n",
  "I enjoyed every bit of the Brownie Brittle, it was delicious. Definitely worth buying. I love the product and if I didn&#39;t try it I would have never thought of buying it!!! Another amazing fact is that the calorie count per ounce isn&#39;t as bad as I thought it would be....I was wowed by the taste!!!! I would recommend to all the brownie lovers on the go \n",
  "Oh man - I cannot tell you how much I loved this. I got the bag and left it on my desk for a while - not really excited to try it. Then I was hungry and had no breakfast - so i busted the bag open. \n\nHoly moly! These are the best snacks ever!!! I made everybody in the office try them - they are delicious. Crispy like a thin cookie and fudgy tasting like a brownie. \n\nI even ran to Pinterest, Twitter and Facebook to tell my friends! \n",
  "To be honest, I&#39;m not much for brownie edges, I&#39;m more of the gooey center kind of girl so when I read that were like the crispy edges I thought eh but I was pretty blown away so much better than brownie edges. These are super chocolately (love the extra chocolate chips!), so much that they enticed my husband who uses passes up all my snacks without a second thought. The second bag I opened while a friend was visiting and it was gone in less than a minute, no kidding. I really wanted to savor them but they were just too dang good. Apparently they come in a bigger size which would not be good for me, they are so tasty, I&#39;m going to finish the bag in one sitting.\n",
  "OMG so Decadent!  Love it.  Best with milk. Really great flavor with melt in your hands chocolate chips.  I do love the chewy part of the brownie too but these are delicious.\n",
  "I got the brownie brittle in the mail and it was really crispy and sweet.  It was okay but nothin beats a regualr brownie.\n",
  "I absolutely LOVE these. If you are looking for a great healthy treat with flavor this is it! I was really excited because I can snack without the guilt. Try these you will love them.\n",
  "The Sheila G Brownie Brittle was soooo good!\n\nThis product was nice a chocolatey, it was a brownie just flattened to perfection.\n\nIt comes in a resealable bag but you wont use it cause you will eat the whole bag.\n",
  "I loved these, a whole bag of the best part of a brownie! Easily could have ate the whole bag at once. Crispy but not burnt  yumminess!",
  "I had not realized that this product had soy in it so I was not able to try it, however, one of my friends was able to try the product and loved it! She said that it was like eating a brownie cookie. She said it tasted amazing and finished the sample in less than a minute! She ended up going out and buying some for herself!\n",
  "I LOVE the brownie brittle!  I love the corners of brownies and this is like getting an entire bag full of them!  I had to hide the bag from everyone in my house, lol we all loved them!\n",
  "I didn&#39;t by themselve, but I did crubmle them up to make a crust for a cheesecake. also a good tooping for icecream.\n",
  "These were great for a sweet crunchy snack!  Perfect when you want a little bit of chocolate and a tiny bit of crunch, but don&#39;t want to get the kitchen hot from the oven.  I&#39;ll be buying more!\n",
  "I found the chocolate chip brownie brittle to be an amazing taste. It satisfies the chocolate craving and it has an amazing texture. Similar to like crisps instead of true brittle...I received two samples of it and will be ordering more. To me the ingredients are fine...Folks be going crazy about ingredients now a days...Everything in moderation unless you have food allergies to soy, wheat, or milk; this should suit you fine as a snack.\n",
  "They&#39;re absolutely delicious, crunchy, chocolaty, and worth every calorie! The chocolate chips melt in your mouth and the brittle is crunchy like a cookie. The bag says brownie brittle but in my opinion it taste more like a cookie brittle. I recommend a glass of milk to go along with this yummy snack. Brownie Brittle is definitely a great snack or dessert!!! \n",
  "When I recieved these, I was very surprised to get a full size bag. Although I dont think the label was right it said 4 pieces per serving and there is no way you can limit yourself to four. These were delicious, crunchy and very sweet. I loved them. Would highly recommend to anyone and dare them to eat just 4\n",
  "I LOVED these little snacks. I&#39;m not a big brownie person so I was hesitant. But, once I opened the bag I couldn&#39;t get enough. They were rich but not overwhelming. I would definitely buy these and recommend them. Thank you Swaggable!\n",
  "They were absolutely delightful. Great taste and flavor. I absolutely loved them and will buy more in the future and recommend to all my friends. Thank you for letting me try them out for free.\n",

  "So I recieved my sample never hearing of this product before, and I feel in love.  It is a liter version of the browine with all of the taste and yummy flavor as if they where fresh browines out of the oven.  I love them, and will keep my eyes open for them at all the stores I shop at.  So far I haven&#39;t been able to find them...but I will be looking.  I can &#39;t wait to share this with my family memebers for the upcoming holidays.\n",
  "I loved this product. It was a great way to share brownies with my toddler, who also loved it. The brownie brittle was good with or without milk and travels well.\n",
  "Sheila&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is a nice light snack that really does taste like the crispy edges of a brownie!  It&#39;s a quick, guilt-free way to get your chocolate fix!!  Did I say these are yummy??  Oh yes!\n",
  "This was very tummy! It really tasted like fresh browsers edges. I was surprised how good they were considering they were low in calories!",
  "These are awesome! Great chocolate flavor and crunch. They taste just like a brownie! I have already bought more since my family devoured the sample. I highly recommend these..but they are addictive :)\n",
  "I really loved them the are like a real brownie but also a cookie. very yummy!! I will recommend them for sure!\n",
  "These are so good!  Really chocolatey but not overpoweringly sweet.  Love the crunch in every bite with the chocolate chips interspersed in there.  I will definitely look for these again!!  YUM!!!\n",
  "OMG these things are the DEVIL!  I received 2 bags to sample and I couldnt putthem down!!   I ate both bags in about 10 minutes.  They are the best part of the brownie, the edge, made into essentially a chip.  They melt in yourmouth and leave you begging for more!!\n",
  "Oh my! This was one of the best sweet treat I have tried in a long time! I loved loved loved Sheila G. Brownie Brittle in chocolate chip. It was chocolate heaven! The only thing I am sad about is that I havent been able to find it any where! I would and have recommend this product to so many people. What I love about this product is It is so versitle. I could see myself putting it on ice cream or even just eat it in a bowl with milk! The flavor is so good! Cant wait to get my hands on another bag! \n",
  "Absolutely delicious! I cant believe these are weight watchers approved! Package was a good size and resealable.",
  "First of all, bravo, for sending a full size sample! I always find that very impressive and it makes it easier to give a true review of something. I have to say that this treat was really different from most chocolatey treats that I normally indulge in. The texture is  little on the dry side, but the flavor is really pretty delicious and fits the bill when you&#39;re looking for a chocolate treat...without busting the calorie bank. It&#39;s a good go to when you need some chocolate, but are watching the calories in anticipation for the holidays ;)\n",
  "The brownie brittle was really good. It was crunchy and had a rich chocolatey taste. I would definately buy these in the future.\n",
  "When I first found out I was getting this I was not sure what to think of it going by name alone. I love brittle and I love brownies but would I love both? Yes I loved them both. The pieces with extra chocolate chips were my favorite part of the whole bag. They do get a little weird tasting if you leave the bag open for a few hours so don&#39;t do that! These are amazing though I will eat more.\n",
  "i didn&#39;t recieve mine to try, it looks delocious but i didn&#39;t get chance to try\n",
  "Very yummmmmmy:) Have purchased since sampling.Perfect for cheat meals!",
  "The chocolate chip is absolutely devine. Being one to go after the gooey center brownie, I wasn&#39;t sure how much of a fan I would be of these but ended up devouring the bad within 2 days. Can&#39;t wait to try the walnut ones.\n",
  "I&#39;m not really the biggest fan of the crispy edges of a brownie, so i was a little nervous to try Brownie Brittle. I was plesantly surprise. this crisp little pieces of brownie are just right. i was expectinh hard pieces of brownie, But instead i got perfectly airy crisp buttery pieces of brownie bit. the flavor wasn&#39;t overwhelming. it&#39;s not to sweet with just the right about of chocolate that burst on your tongue as you crunch. delicious. and doesn&#39;t make you feel as guilty as eating a real brownie. so there&#39;s a plus. browies on the go. got to love it.\n",
  "oh my gosh these were so good! I loved them. I want more of them. They tasted fabulous!\n",
  "The Brownie Brittle was delish. I crushed them up and put them on top of ice cream. Yummy\n",
  "This product was delicious!! We are going to be buying a bigger bag of the Brownie Brittle from Costco! Be careful though as it is very addicting ;-) I was surprised at how much it really tasted like brownies! This is my new everyday dessert!!",
  "These brownie brittle bites were truly amazing, every bite was great. After a meal I always feel like eating some thing sweet, and these brittles were the perfect size and tast for just that. Every bit is amazing, so much flavor, not too overpowering just great. I love love love these not only did I love them but so did my husband and kids. Totally recommend these. \n",
  "If you are a fan of brownie edges, then Brownie Brittle is perfect for you.  Based on the name, I was expecting something more akin to Peanut Brittle; that sticky candy that is hard to eat.  However, this is like very thin, crunchy, brownie bites.  I love that they they are made all-natural.\n",
  "This crunchy Chocolate treat will make any Chocolate lover go nuts. At only 120 calories per serving, you won&#39;t feel guilty getting your chocolate fix for the day. I paired my brownie brittle with Almond milk for an after dinner treat. This product has a rich chocolate flavor you would get from a fresh baked batch of brownies, without the high calories. I would recommend this product to every, whether you are trying to watch your weight or just want a jolt of Chocolate. Brownie brittle is a great product that can be enjoyed by the whole family.\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was pretty good. It is definitely very crunchy and buttery and I do think that brownie edge lovers would love this. I, however, am not really an edge person and prefer the moist inside pieces of the brownies! I think I would like this better if it had more chocolate chips in it as I really liked the bites I got that had chocolate in them but they seemed too far apart! I&#39;m a chocolate lover though...\n",
  "These chocolate chip brownie brittles are my new favorite way to eat chocolate!!! I loved them and they are not as bad as other snack foods nutrition wise. They tasted just like a brownie. I loved them and will be recommending them to all my family and friends.\r\n",
  "I actually liked the chocolate chip brownie brittle. I thought it tasted like yummy edge pieces,left in the bottom of the pan for a day.",
  "My family LOVED these!  They have the perfect texture.  We are hoping to buy these in the future if we can find them.\n",
  "This stuff is dangerously good. It&#39;s not at all like a brittle along the lines of peanut brittle, with a hard caramel like candy holding it together. It is more like a crunchy brownie chip, with chunks of chocolate thrown in for good measure. If you like brownies you will love this treat. It is very easy to inhale an entire bag in minutes.\n",
  "I have to say these were wonderful!!  My mom and I ate and bragged on this Brownie Brittle.  My daughter even loved it and she is a very picky eater.  I have to give this product an A+\n",
  "every one in my family loved them they were a hit \n",
  "Ehmergerd! These things are delicious! They remind me of the crispy crunch part of the brownie at the end of the baking pan,which i absoultly love! Tast and calorie wise these brownies are amazing! You must try these out!\n",
  "This product was SO incredibly delicious! I was impressed with the size of the sample that I received. The bag itself was very high quality, sophisticated, and gourmet looking. I couldn&#39;t WAIT to try it! I was pleasantly surprised by how much flavor was packed into each piece. It really did taste exactly like a fresh, chocolatey brownie made into a crispy, thin brittle. The product had a GREAT chocolate taste without being sickening sweet. I thought it tasted very natural and homemade, too, which was nice. I would highly recommend this product and will definitely be buying it again in the future! SO delicious!!!!!\n",
  "I thought these were really unique and clever little crisps. They tasted like brownie cookie crisps. I like the name brownie brittle too. They were delicious and my son really liked them, as well. They had chocolate chips in them too, which I really enjoyed. I hope this company comes out with more varieties,as well. I would definately recommend this product and I plan on purchasing these when I find them in the stores. Brownie Brittle was a very tasty little treat that I enjoyed a lot.\n",
  "absolutely delicious!!! It tastes just like a brownie! definitely would buy!! so crispy and delicious!!\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is simply amazing.  The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was the delicious aroma.  That alone made me want to dig right in, so that&#39;s exactly what I did.  My son and I sampled this together.  It was so good that we ate the entire bag in one sitting!  The chocolately flavor is just perfect, and we loved the crispiness.  The best part to me was knowing that it was lower in calories.  My son just loved the taste.  I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family, and I will certainly purchase another bag when I&#39;m able to find it in a store near me.\n",
  "This was surprisingly awesome! I was very skeptical of anything that is a replacement of my favorite dessert. But this was so yummy! I ate it all myself! So very surprising \n",
  "loved! the chocolate brownie cookies! loved loved i will b pruchasing more of then. so tasting &along with a glass of milk.. yummy\n",
  "I love this I will be purchasing this in the future\n",
  "WOW!!!  This is definitely the most delcious snack I&#39;ve had all year.  I took our bag on a hike to share with friends, but I wish I hadn&#39;t lol.  They were too good to share!  The chocolate flavor is nice and light (I hate dark chocolate) and the crispy texture is perfect for snacking on.  They are still really rich and it doesn&#39;t take much to feel satisfied.  I hope I can find another bag soon!  THANKS!!!\n",
  "Wow, that&#39;s all I can say. The best of a brownie but in brittle form! Perfect for snacking. Just the right amount of chocolateness and crispy texture to satisfy any sweet tooth!\n",
  "I love brownies and I love brittle, so when I saw a combo of both I was very interested to try it out. This Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was so good. It was&#39;nt too hard like most brittles. It taste great. My husband and son loved it and they are very picky. I would recommend them to anyone. Even people who are trying to lose weight since they were named as a hot item by Weight Watchers. \n",
  "OMG ~ the best and worst product I have ever reviewed!!!  The best for many reason: the taste, the texture, the chocolate chips and the worst becasue now I am addicted and stalk the stores looknig for it!!  I am getting about 10 people this for shristmas instead of baking cookies this year I enjoyed it so much!! \n",
  "I havent tryed them yet when i do i will do a review",
  "SO, I loved sheila g&#39;s brownie brittle, it is sooo good, the chocolate tatste is very rich in the chocolate flavore, and also has a strong brownie tatste!! I also gave some to my son n he loved them so much aswell, the only down fall i have toadmit is that the brownie brittle got a little messy with crumbs, but that&#39;s really my only complaint considering it is brownie brittle, but otherthen that five stars on my list and i will def order more, I even got my mom too buy some!!! The brownie brittle is awesome!!!!!! <3\n",
  "Brownie Brittle was delious & yummy. It was different then any brownies I ever had.\n",
  "What can I say I was amazed by brownie brittle. I was little worried it would be hard as a rock but was surpised by its texture. And it taste so good and the choclate chips were will portion on each piece . Heck it was so good my kids were fighting over the few crumbs that were left in the bag. What I thought was so thoughtful when you receive this sample bag Sheila G gives you a coupon I wish ever product I bought in the store was like that. Brownie brittle is crispy & crunchy at the same time. I believe this new snack will be hit those who love the corners of the brownie but be fore warned once you start eating you have a hard time stoping. The chocalate smell just hypotize as well as the taste I just wish our bag would have lasted longer then 10 minutes. That&#39;s how good this brittle. You have to try it\n",
  "Yummy nice and crunchy and chocolates my son told wait you got free chocolate in the mail I said yup do you want to try it and said yes please it was delicious we ate the whole bag watching movies! ",
  "Omg I love love these. They taste even better than the actually brownie crunchy sides.",
  "I was so skeptical about this product when I first received it. I love Brownies and there is nothing better than a fluffy warm out of the oven brownie , and here in this bag are square pieces of brownie, like peanut brittle...I did enjoy them, but not as much as my kids did !  The 2 bags barely lasted in my home. They were a bit dry but definitely an awesome new go to snack ! \n",
  "First off, what an awesome amount for a sample. Recieved 2 snack size bags to try. Plus coupons. \n\nThe Brownie brittle was delish! I am a hugggeeee fan of the pieces of brownie that stick to the pan after you bake and these tasted exactly like that! Perfect chocolate flavor, not too sweet, and light cookie crunch made me feel better about eating the whole bag! Lol! Gave the other bag to my 5 year old, and husband to share and they both loved them too. Would definitely repurchase. Yum :)",
  "My daughgter, 15, tasted this at a sampling at Sam&#39;s Club the week before I got my sample in. She wanted me to buy it. I didn&#39;t. When I got my sampling in from Swaggable, she took off with it. I didn&#39;t even get to smell it. So, I&#39;m assuming it is delicious. She said that it tastes so good. Pefrectly crunchy and chocolately. And, if you need to know, they are pretty low in calories (if you can keep from eating the whole bag) and Weight Watchers named them on their snack list.. Now, they will be added to my shopping list for Sam&#39;s Club. Oh, and FYI they don&#39;t melt in the car either. We took them on a trip and left them in the glove box. They were fine when we retrieved them.........until my daughter got ahold of them and ate them all. :( I guess I will have to buy me some and hide them from her. Shh...... don&#39;t tell.\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was so good!!  My fiance and I could not stop eating it.  We ate the entire bag together!  I would def recommend and buy!  A great snack... A++!\n",
  "I am so glad someone thought about brownie chips is so good even my teen kids like them I really enjoy this new kind of sack",
  "OMG!!!! This is THE BEST snack food ever!!!! Couldn&#39;t wait to open it and try it, and once I did, I could not put it down!!!! I am going grocery shopping tomorrow and will definately purchase me some more.  Of course I will have to get several because my husband was fighting me to get some of it.  All I can say is GO OUT AND GET YOU SOME Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle.\n",
  "I have to start out with HOOLLLLLLLLY MOLY!  These were sooooo good! I&#39;m not even a huge fan of the crunchy corners but I LOVED this! I plan on ordering a good amount for my womderful amazing neighbor who just could die for the corners and lovesss brownies. I can&#39;t even say enough awesomeness about this product, my mouth is watering just typing this out. One of the many things that I did really like is that when I opened up the bag it didn&#39;t just have a couple in there, the bag had a good amount of product in it which was vwey welcomed my my kids and I!  My kids started chowing down on this before I could even get to it and I had to take it away and put it up so they wouldn&#39;t eat the whole thing in one sitting! Which I had to stop myself from doing as well! These definitely are on my must have Christmas list!\n",
  "I thought this really was a great idea for a snackable Brownie Crisp Treat. My favorite part of a brownie is the crispy ends this was perfect. Even my Very Picky Daughter loved it. I hope you come out with more great flavors. It also had a great brownie taste that i wasnt expecting and Brownie Brittle is a Brillant name for this product.\n",
  "I really loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle!\n\nMy 4 year old said she loved it also and we both want to try the salted caramel version!\n\nI crumbled a few pieces and ate it in some ice cream and it was so yummy!\n\nI also enjoyed a few squares as a snack with my afternoon coffee break!\n",
  "Perfect snack, now if I could only eat a few and not the whole bag.  The perfect option for the person who likes the crispy edges of brownies.  YUM!\n",
  "I was really unsure of what to expect but from the name I thought brittle? So it might be super hard then. Not the case with Sheila G&#39;s they were firm yet easy to break into sections if you like smaller bites. Ive tried some brownies that are not dry and dull, these are far from it!!! They are packed full of chocolate oh-so-yummy delights. Not only are they delicious but for someone who watches what they eat this is the perfect snack. I have to say I loved that they are made with natural ingredients as well as peanut free. I actually was shocked that these are from weightwatchers. You get tons of yummy flavor and taste and not all the empty calories. The chocolate chips in them make for the perfect combination with milk. I did enjoy that they were an easy and simple snack to go for. Quick for on the go or if you are like me, I need that chocolate fix on certain days. I had the perfect idea too if you want a little of both worlds you can buy some organic yogurt or ice cream the brownie brittles are perfect for dipping in them. I have to say I would recommend these to friends and family but they are too good to share! Just be prepared if you eat brownie brittle that you cannot just eat one. They are too good to put down the bag, and more than likely you will eat the entire bag in one sitting or possibly one day. But for 120 calories it is completely worth it. I am on the hunt for these in my area and doing follow up on the brand. Do yourself a favor if you see these, do not pass them up just go ahead and add a few extra in your cart :)\n",
  "I do not like that they are so thin. I love the quality of the chocolate chip. But the quality of the chocolate chip should have come with a bigger cookie. \n",
  "Really tastes like the crunchy edge of a brownie pan.  I kinda liked them it takes a lot for me to like crunchy chocolate, but my son on the other hand loved them and would have sat down and ate the whole bag if I let him. Also shared with some of my friends and they loved it!\n\nI would buy this again as a treat for the kids and to set out at a party for a snack.\n",
  "Oh my goodness if these were not delicious I don&#39;t knwo what is. I had to hide the second bag from myself for a couple of days so I did not pig out on them. They had the perfect texture and crunch with amazing brownie flavor .. yummmm\n",
  "Personally,  Im a brownie junkie!  Its my go to snack of choice. I was excited to Brownie Brittle as an alternative way to enjoy my favorite snack. \n\nPros: Delicious, rich chocolate flavor in every bite. \n\nCons: The consistency was more of a cookie than a brittle. The pieces were also small and fragile. Overall great flavor though! ",
  "I didnt think I would like these at all. Thought they would taste like burnt brownies for some reason but omg they were so yummy I had to stop myself from eating the whole bag! Super chocolates with a satisfying crunch. Ill be buying these again soon :-)",
  "Atfirst I have to admit I was a little concerned about brownie brittle. Hard brownies can be well burnt or have no flavor. The flavor was was really good not quite a brownie, but very close. They do not absorb liquid very easily. So you can&#39;t dunk them. The chocolate chips added just a little more variety. My 16 month old, 7 year old, and husband all loved them!\n",
  "I received Shelia G Brownie Brittle from Swaggable recently and would totally recommend this if you like the crunchy parts of brownies.Im going to look for this in stores now because its so good!!",
  "If you love brownies and chocolate this is a fantastic snack for you!",
  "I received Sheila Gs Brownie Brittle in the mail the other day. Anytime something to arrives in the mail the kids get all excited and I usually have to fight them over the package. We were especially excited open this one up. As we all love brownies and my absolutely favorite parts are the edges and corners. Now theres a great snack that have just that. Nothing but crispy, crunchy, chocolatey brownie pieces made in the perfect little squares that are great for popping in your mouth. Its hard to eat just a few, the whole bag was gone before I knew it. Thank goodness they sent us two bags  Now just keep these away from the kids... Well the next day my nine year old daughter decided that Sheila Gs Brownie Brittle was going to be the featured snack and her exclusive Tea Party for her friends. The Brownie Brittle was a hit there too! The little girls couldnt get enough and we had to run out and get more, using our coupon of course! In my opinion, the best part of this great treat is the fact that Sheila Gs Brownie Brittle is that it is a WeightWatchers Hot snack, is low in fat and calories. Which make Sheila Gs Brownie Brittle and guilt free sweet indulgence and perfect for my family.",
  "I LOVE these! LIght, crispy, and chocolately without being too hard or crunchy. Also I think it&#39;s a great portion size if you&#39;re watching calories and craving a chocolate treat! I would reccommend these to anyone! I have also tried the mint flavor and although yummy, not quite as great as the original! \n",
  "This is great fun snack for the whole family, with it rich chocolate chips. I would recommend this to anyone, I&#39;ll be buying this for sure!!\n",
  "Amazing yummy crunchy goodness! The best part of the brownies!!!",
  "These were absolutely amazing!! I love the edges of the brownies and this gave you several in a bag! The flavor was nice and chocolatey and they went great with a glass of milk!! I will definitely purchase these again!! Thanks for the sample!!!\n",
  "I tried the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. It was so amazing. I thought it would be hard on my teeth but I was more than surprised. It was so light and airy. It tasted like the fresh crunch off a brownie straight out the oven. The chocolate chips were light and creamy, I would have added more but the quantity was good. yum yum yum!\n",
  "I really enjoyed the brownie brittle. I had heard about it awhile back, just never tried it.I loved it.Will buy in the future. It&#39;s chocolate, light and crispy. Delish.\n",
  "Ordinarily, I&#39;m not a huge fan of brownies... Thick, soft gooey brownies don&#39;t appeal to me. That&#39;s why, when I received my sample of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle, I was a bit hesitant... But, when I bit into the crispy, crunchy Brownie Brittle snacks, I fell in love! I love the crunch of the Brownie Brittles! It&#39;s like getting a bit of the brownie edge piece, which I definitely prefer over soft, gooey-ness. If you love crunch—you gotta try Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle!\n",
  "I love brownies so this was very exciting to try. When I got them in the mail I was thrilled. They were such a delicious treat. I paired them with a nice cup of milk. The little chocolate chis in the brownie brittle really made them amazing. They had such a rich chocolate taste. I am hooked!",
  "As a chocolate and brownie enthusiast, a product like this couldnt have been any better. The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was a light and delicious snack. We went out a purchased a bag right away!",
  "I received the chocolate chip Brownie Brittle to review.  It comes in a convenient ziploc resealable bag so you can have a few bites, reseal and it stays fresh.  My daughter and I both liked the brownie brittle.  It&#39;s a nice crunchy and light snack.  I liked the real chocolate chips in each piece.  If you like the crunchy pan edges of baked brownies, you&#39;ll love brownie brittle.\n \n",
  "The chocolate chip is absolutely devine.Delicious & satisfying! Except you can&#39;t eat just one.They are crispy and full of flavor.More like a very thin layer of brownie batter that&#39;s crispy and broken up in large and small pieces.\n",
  "I Love these! They taste better than htey look! I enjoyed eating them with a hot cup of coffee.\n",
  "OMG, was this brownie brittle absolutely delicious! My husband and son were fighting over the crumbs............Okay, you got me, so was I. Hands down thee best sweet new product I&#39;ve tried in years. The flavor is fantastic, the texture is not too dry therefore just right, and the bag was gone within a couple of hours. We have since purchased a couple bags and we will continue to make future purchases of Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle!\n",
  "\n\n\n\n\n            var fctb_tool=null;\n            function FCTB_Init_187a65bb265b4017bff9155d5362f568(t)\n            {\n                fctb_tool=t;\n\t\t\t\tstart(fctb_tool);\n            }\n            FCTB_Init_187a65bb265b4017bff9155d5362f568(document[FCTB_Init_2acacb0f1e0b48bf96bc2252bf5692e6]); delete document[FCTB_Init_2acacb0f1e0b48bf96bc2252bf5692e6]\nSo, I was a little worried about how this Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle would taste and how crunchy it would be.  I&#39;m not really a fan of the edge of the brownie; I much prefer the inside softness.\n\nAfter tasting the Brownie Brittle, I am sold!  I&#39;ll be looking for this in stores so that I can buy more!  The pieces are crunchy, but not so hard that it&#39;s hard to eat.  The flavor...it&#39;s chocolate, of course the flavor is good. \n",
  "I absolutely love it! Tastes just like the crust on brownies :) ",
  "I honestly didn&#39;t think I would like them cause I&#39;m the the lover of the crispy parts of food, but I have to say I really enjoyed them. They had a great taste and they weren&#39;t too hard or crispy which was a definitely plus for me!\n",
  "Delish!  Perfect gift for the person who has everything.  Would totally buy!  Loved the size and taste.  Not too sweet.  ",
  "Crunchy brownie goodness in sizeable sheets. No more picking tiny bits off the ends of large brownie pans for me.\n",
  "The next best thing to a whole brownie. I love these because the crunchy part of the brownie is my favorite. It has only 120 calories and made with all natural ingredients. I would recommend this to my friends although they would have to get their own bags, because I am not gonna share!\n",
  "Truth is the sample came in and before I could get to it either my husband and/or son got to it. I had to go and buy a bag to check it out for myself and they are pretty good. It’s a different kind of snack, when you’re looking for something sweet and crunchy. \n",
  "Can&#39;t Stop Eating This Stuff\nThis product is a very crispy chocolate chocolate chip cookie. It is described on the bag as the crispy part of a brownie, but it really reminds me more of a well done cookie.each piece is very crispy and the flavor is fantastic. It is low calories and fulfills my cravings.\n",
  "It was really good. I tasted just like the crispy edges of the brownie when you make them at home. I would have like to try them with nuts or something, because it was a chocolate overload! But all in all I will recommend them to anyone who has a chocolate craving, and like the edges to the brownie!\n",
  "These were the best i ever tasted!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even my husband loved them. I would recommend them to all my family and friends. They were lite and crunchy with a very good chocolate flavor.!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
  "Crispy browny cookies is what they should be known as. Totally tasty with low fat compared to it&#39;s brother... real brownies. It is a fun way to eat a treat while still staying on your diet. \n",
  "OH MY GOODNESS!! This has got to be one of the best brownie treats I have ever had. I ate the whole bag as soon as I got it. The idea of the product is to give everyone the crisp, crunchy brownie edges of fresh baked brownies (which is the creator&#39;s favorite part). To be honest, I hate brownie edges. I am the center of the brownie person... BUT THESE! These are different. They are like a brownie cookie. They are so much better than the actually brownie edges.\n",
  "Chrunchy little pieces, packed with big flavor.  I would definitely recommend Brownie Brittle as a snack when you are craving both sweet and crunchy.  The sweetness is just perfect and the crunch is outstanding.  I would buy this, now that I&#39;ve tried these.\n\nGrab a glass of milk and tell your family to get their own...you might not want to share, it&#39;s THAT good!\n",
  "Oh my goodness! This brittle is absolutely delicious! My husband, son, and I ate the entire bag in one day. My son who is very picky eater actually asked for more, even though he had a piece in each hand and in his mouth lol. I will definitely be scouring the grocery store for another bag.",
  "This brownie brittle is so delicious! It just melts in your mouth and is so crunchy. Every piece tastes like the corner piece that is the best! Highly recommend this addictive chocolate treat. Goes great with a cold glass of milk.\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was so good. I am going to start buying these once in awhile. I would tell everyone to taste this. They were really good with a glass of milk\n",
  "This was an interesting snack/treat. I enjoyed it because the calories were reasonable for a sweet chocolate snack/dessert, and they tasted good. It was like a nice brownie or cookie chip. This was a fun treat to try and I always like trying things that are lower in calories than most snacks and sweets but still taste good.\n",
  "Delicious!! I loved Brownie Brittle and thought it was a fresh, new idea. Who would have ever thought to turn brownies into brittle? As a fan of both, I thought the combination was terrific! Believe me, I&#39;ll be using the coupon that was included for another package!\n",
  "The choccaolate chip brittles was good they wsnt to swet js right i would buy them any day.\n",
  "This is the best thing i&#39;ve recieved from Swaggable yet. BEWARE: these are so addicting! You can&#39;t have just one.\n\n \n\nIt&#39;s advertised as being for people that love the edges of baked brownies. I usually go straight for the middle because I like the softest parts but this has turned me! They&#39;re rich, crispy chocolatey and delicious. I&#39;ll definitely be buying these when they come out. NOM!\n",
  "I really loved the sample of Sheila G.&#39;s Brownie Brittle.  Each little square was crispy, crunchy and oh so chocolatey!  The snack size bag was has 2 portions that are only 120 each!  Plus Brownie Brittle is made with all natural ingredients.  They are a tasty treat right out of the bag and would be great to eat with ice cream, yogurt, pudding, fruit, etc.  I recommend these and will definitely be buying them in the future.\n",
  "This was an amazing treat! I wasn&#39;t expecting much because we aren&#39;t really fans of the edge brownies in this house, but they were so good! I sat down with the bag thinking I was just going to try a few, nope, I ate the entire bag in one sitting! Very crunchy, great chocolate flavor, and made with natural ingredients. DELICIOUS! I saved a bag for my boys, ages 9 and 10, and they loved them as well. I&#39;m not sure if they really even fully tasted them because I&#39;m pretty sure they inhaled them, they were gone so fast!\n",
  "Wow! I love brownies, I love brittle... Therefore I LOVE Chocolate Brittle!!! I was a little wary before trying, seeing as it looks dry in the picture on the package. I was pleasantly surprised with the results, in fact I barely shared the bag with my husband! (He got one piece!)... The flavor was wonderful, the crunch was satisfying, and the calorie count wasn&#39;t a total diet buster! I will be going out a buying more!\n",
  "I absolutely loved this brownie brittle! Who doesn&#39;t love and fight for all the edge pieces when you have brownies? With the brownie brittle you don&#39;t have to fight for all those crispy, chewy pieces because you have a whole bag of that goodness. I did not get weighed down by carbs either considering I ate the whole bag! Loved them and would recommend them to everyone and have already told all my friends! Thanks Swaggable:)\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle by Sheila G&#39;s I was invited to try was very tasty, crunchy, and just like having a brownie without having a whole brownie. The product tasted just like a brownie, light and thin. I enjoyed that the snacks are peanut-free, certified-Kosher, made with natural ingredients, and named Best New Snack Product of the year by National Confectionery Sales Association. Only 120 calories an ounce and named as a hot item by WeightWatchers.com. I would recommend this product. I would consider buying this. I did research the product and the price I saw was a little out of my budget but if I could afford to splurge I would purchase this every now and them.\n",
  "Yum this was delicious. Everyone who tried it love it. Used my coupon to buy the toffee flavor and it is just as good. This is a new dessert favorite in my house.",
  "These were yummy my daughter also really liked them",
  "This is a funny concept.  I enjoyed having chocolate, and the idea of having the crisy parts of the brownies to eat was kind of cool.  I wouldn&#39;t say it was the best tasting brownies I have ever had, but they were pretty good.  The only thing was that they were messy to eat.\n",
  "I love.love.love this.A brownie brittle  was so yummy. Evry female in my family loved it. The coupon was nice as we inhaled the bag and had to go out and buy some.\n",
  "Chocolate lovers rejoice! This product is for you. Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle has a deep chocolate flavor that is evenly distributed throughout the product. The Brittle is light and crispy, and a serving is a reasonable 1 ounce (the bag I tried was 4 ounces total). For the serving the calories are reasonable and the chocolate packs a punch. I am going to look for this product in stores, and I look forward to trying the different flavors available.\n",
  "My hole family loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle.  It was a great snack, delicious and satisfied both the urge for chocolate and the urge for something crunchy. My only complaint is that when the brownie brittle settled there was a lot of chocolate dust in the bottom of the bag, but it could be because they were shipped to me. Great product :)\n",
  "The day I recieved my box in the mail I was excited. To be honest I was a little skeptical about this product but once I tried it I was in love. Before I was never a real fan of the crispy side bits on a pan of brownies but this product has changed that. Thank you!\n",
  "When the chocolate chip brittle package came, it came in a box, so that it wont break like in an envelope. \nThe chocolate chip brownie brittle is amazing. It tastes great. So fresh and crunchy. I was having some with my son, who emptied out the bag, and asked for more.",
  "i wasnt expecting it to taste that great but it was amazing it tasted so good my son stole the bag and finsihed of now we are looking to buy it from the stoe \n",
  "These brownie bites were delicious! I couldnt put the bag down. I loved the thin texture. Will buy!",
  "OMG I LOVE these!! THey are the perfect sweet snack! They are very light and crispy, but full of great chocolate flavor! They only problem is trying not to eat the whole bag in one sitting! They come in a variety of flavors and I can&#39;t wait to try the others. My husband and I fight over the crispy edges of brownies, now we have a whole bag to share!\n",
  "These were pretty good, tasted exactly like brownies, but in brittle form.Think i will pass on purchasing these tho, I rather have real brownies.\n",
  "Sample never came. Would love to review- but, I can&#39;t :( \n",
  "\nMore than brownie brittle I found them to be like brownie chips, none the less, they tasted great! I love having them a snack without over indulging. I love making a base of this for ice cream or topping it on my oatmeal. I will be including these in gift baskets for the holidays for sure! Get some sweet crunch on! \n\n",
  "I cannot say enough about this Brownie Brittle. It may have survived all of 5 minutes after I opened it. My husband and I devoured it with guiltless pleasure! Yum, yum, yum! Also important to mention, you don&#39;t have to like crispy brownies to like it :)\n\nMy only complaint? I haven&#39;t been able to find them in a local store!\n",
  "This has to be the best snack I have ever tried. They were so good, not to sweet, just the right chocolate chip to chocolate ratio, the perfect texture and crispyness. I actually had to limit myself on them before I ate the entire bag. All three of my children tried them as well and loved them, asked me to buy more. This was definitely a hit in our house, keep up the great work Sheila G I want to try a peanut brittle!\n",
  "Oh my gosh! These brownie brittles were awesome!!! I think I have actually bought 10 more bags just to eat myself. It makes brownies so much easier and better. \n",
  "These were very delicious!! We enjoyed them alot, everyone in the family always fights over the edge piece of the brownie pan! This makes it so much nicer to have that crisp brownie piece without all the extra work! It tastes just like the real thing, can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors! Thanks for the sample\n",
  "These were amazing.  They had the crunch of a chip but the awesome taste of a brownie.  I loved them!!!",
  "I tried the Chocolate chip brownie brittle and i loved the flavor.  It makes for a great snack when you just sitting around or on the go.  It also doesn&#39;t have a lot of calories so please pick this up and try it out.\n",
  "This were awesome!  My kids really enjoyed it and want me to buy it for them.\n",
  "I was really intriqued by the concept of the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. I have to say, it is very addictive. I will for sure reccomend this and I will be buying more for myself for sure. I love that they are only 120 calories/ounce,\n",
  "I enjoyed the taste of the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle - it tastes like brownies, what&#39;s not to like? It was more the texture that got me. Call me crazy, but when I&#39;m craving a brownie I want a brownie not a cookie. When I ate this all it really did was make me want an actual brownie. Plus, maybe this happened becuase the sample was shipped, it seemed a lot of the pieces had been smashed so I had a handful of decent sized chunks and then a ton of crumbs left at the bottom of the bag. Since I didn&#39;t want to tip the bag o&#39;crumbs into my mouth and end up with a mess I ended up tossing a lot of perfectly tasty chocolate.\n",
  "Oh my gosh this stuff was the most delicious thing ive ever tasted!! Wish i could get more!\n",
  "My family really enjoyed this. They said they tasted great and were fun sized.",
  "I never received but ended up buying this product on my own and I love it. Its so crisp and chocolatey the perfect snack.\n",
  "This was a wonderful snack!~ Everyone loved them!~ The taste was excellent!~ Thank You!~\n",
  "I sampled Sheila Gs: The Original Brownie Brittle Companys Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle and my overall experience with it was okay. I really enjoyed that it was a crispy texture, almost like a chocolate chip brownie chip, because Im someone that loves the crispy edges of brownies when you bake them. The flavor was okay, chocolatey, but kinda tasted like Cocoa Puffs cereal, I almost felt like you could use this brownie brittle as cereal. The chocolate chips were the best part of the product. This makes a good snack that satisfies those chocolate, cookie, sweets cravings that we all sometimes get. Honestly though, I most likely wouldnt buy Sheila Gs: The Original Brownie Brittle Companys Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle on my own, unless I maybe found it in a dollar store.",
  "These brownie bites were delicious. They tasted like the edges of a brownie. I love that they are made with all natural ingredients. Great snack!!\n",
  "excellent chocolate cookie, it was the best brownie flavor i never had been try it\n",
  "best chocolate bronie flavor snack ever, it was so delicious, i love it\n",
  "Its the best part of a brownie. It taste really yummy, I love this product. I can&#39;t wait to get more. I love that they are not too sweet, they are just right. They taste like home made brownies. \n",
  "I would definitely recommend Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. It was perfectly chocolatey, crispy and went great with almond milk, just like a good brownie. I couldn&#39;t keep my hands off them and now I&#39;m looking to buy some more.\n",
  "I honestly really liked these and will be buying them again. They had a nice chocolaty flavor that was satisfying  along with a good crunch.  My daughter even liked them and its an easy non messy snack that you can enjoy.\n",
  "I Love Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle it is delicious like a real brownie but crispy like a cookie.\n",
  "I received a generous sample of Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle!  TWO bags!  I shared this delicious snack with my husband and my son and we all agreed that this stuff is AMAZING!!!!!!!  It&#39;s addictive!   I have to buy some now, because now that we&#39;ve embarked on this culinary journey, there is no turning back.  The taste of a rich, chocolatey brownie, combined with the crisp-ness of a ginger snap. They taste so decadent!   I would recommend this product to anyone who loves chocolate! :)  \n",
  "This was my first time trying this product. I can describe it in one word: AMAZING! It tastes exactly like the corner of a brownie! It has a delicious crispy crunch, and really satisfies my sweet tooth. The chocolate chips really add something to the whole experience. One warning though...once you start, its hard to stop! These are DELICIOUS!",
  "This was fantastic.  It was everything it is described as being.  My husband immediately confiscated the second sample and declared that it tasted like the crunchy edges of the brownie that he enjoys so much.  It is chocolately without being too sweet and overwhelming.  I would definitely recommend giving this a try if you are at all curious. \n",
  "It&#39;s not bad, I had high hopes.  I do like it, but it tastes like somebody mixed up brownie batter and simply spread it real thin on a cookie sheet and overbaked it.\n",
  "One word YUM.  When I first opened the bag, oh the smell was wonderful! (MMMM)  When I looked at the actual brittle, I wasn&#39;t to impressed, however when I took a bite and to my surprise----BAM----It was bursting with chocolate brownie flavor!  I was actually concerned if I could eat it or not, only because other brands of brittle are so hard to chew, not this brittle! And the texture was very pleasing, so I asked my daughter, here do you want some chocolate chip brownie brittle,  got as a sample from swaggable?&#39;  She looked at me and said, what is that?&#39;   I gave her a piece and she said,&#39; mmmm, not to bad.&#39; And then asked for another piece. I&#39;m going to give this one a ten of ten! You&#39;ve done it again swaggable! Nice sample here. Ask me and I&#39;ll tell you to go out and buy a bag,\n",
  " I really enjoyed the brownie brittle! It was very yummy! I will be buying it in the store soon!\n",
  "The other day I walked into the office of my apartment complex to pick up a package that had been sitting there for about a week. I&#39;ve been so busy, I had forgotten about it for a while. I knew what it was.. something I had ordered a while ago, but was pleasantly surprised when the manager handed me not one, but two packages! Oh! My Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle sample was here! Yay! I was craving chocolate, too!\n\nI opened the box to find two of Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle packages. At first I was disappointed. The packaging is not very attractive; it didn&#39;t make me want to try these. Plus it&#39;s a WeightWatcher&#39;s hot item, so it must be only OKAY. Already judging that this snack was going to be blah, I opened the package to take a taste.\n\nOh. My. Goodness.\n\nDid my grandmother just bake a batch of perfect brownies, cut off the crispy parts and mail it to me in a care package? Because that&#39;s exactly what these taste like!!  \n\nAgain, I found myself disappointed. But this time it was because I ate both packages in one sitting.\n",
  "These brownie brittle bites were absolutely delicious! ",
  "I never received my sample from Swaggable, which I was really bummed about. So I purchased the product myself because I really wanted to try it. This stuff is really good! And the portion size is just right. My only complaint is that the product is expensive and the 4oz bag only has 4 servings. ",
  "By Latoya Johnson \n\nSo I just received Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle in the mail today, and I must say, am I very delighted to have a new favorite go-to snack!  I love the flavor of the rich chocolate, and the crunchiness in terms of texture.  I personally don&#39;t like the mushy part of a brownie so this snack really hit the mark for me.  Know I know why Sheila G&#39;s is award-winning, because her product is just fantastic.  Anyone who is a chocolate lover can and will appreciate this product.  Needless to say, Sheila G&#39;s has been named a hot item by the acclaimed WeightWatchers.com site.  This product exceeded my expectations!  \n",
  "I  was completely unsure of this Brownie Brittle when I first heard about it.  OMG!   These are the best thing ever!   Really, EVER!   If you love the  crispy  edges of brownies in the pan,  you are going to really love Brownie Brittle!   Delicious squares of heaven without turning on the oven. ",
  "These are amazing!! I absolutely love the flavor and the fact that Im not getting all the calories of a regular brownie but definetly all of the flavor! I will be purchasing these again and again!",
  "I absolutely loved this Brownie Brittle! It is amazing. Imagine all the brownie edges and crumbs in one.....thats what his tastes like! Delicious!  I would recommend to anyone that loves brownies! What a great snack!!",
  "Yummy! If you love brownies then you will love this product. It taste just like a brownie, but with a crunch. It was so delicious that I had a hard time putting it down. The brittle was such a great twist for the brownie. It was sweet and had a great chocolate taste. \n",
  "I loved the Sheila G.&#39;s Brownie Brittle sample that was sent to me. It is the perfect snack for me. I loved the chocolate taste and the crunchy texture. I will definately be purchasing more! Thank you so much for the opportunity to try this product!\n",
  "Crispy, chocolatey deliciousness in each bite!  This was my first taste of brownie brittle, but it will not be my last!  The initial first crunch is everything you think it would be--light and crispy.  Then you get the full flavor of one of the baked-in chocolate chips and there&#39;s an instant rush of extra creamy chocolate to go along with the crunch.  Absolute perfection, in my opinion.  There is a fairly good amount in each bag (which is the size of a small personal potato chip bag) and only 240 calories for the whole bag.  (which is a good thing because I may or may not have already eaten the whole bag.)  This item is already on my grocery shopping list!\n",
  "OMG This was so good . Very yummy and tasty.\n",
  "These taste fantastic! Everyone in my family loved these.\n",
  "I was extremely excited to find out that I would be getting the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle to sample. When I first heard of the name I thought that it would be more hard like a peanut brittle but it turned out to have just a little bit of crunch. The brownie tastes amazing!!!! It is filled with yummy chocolate flavor and has a good amount of brittle per bag. I ate the first bag in on sitting and then made the mistake of opening the second bag and taking a few bites and putting it away in the pantry. I went back a few days later to finish the bag and the crunch was no longer there and they tasted a bit soggy. I would recommed eating the entire bag at one time and not saving them for later.\n",
  "My new MOST favorite chocolate treat!!!  Yummmm!!!   Browniw Brittle is amazing!!!\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was so good! My favorite part of brownies in a bag! Love them!  =)\n",
  "Really loved this product! very tasty treat, has the flavor of the crispy edge of a fresh batch of brownies yum! This tasty treat is also low in calories. I highly recommend if you have a have brownie craving but don&#39;t want all the calories!\n",
  "Omg these brownie brittles were so good, I loved the pieces that had the chocolate chips all over the top of them.  Even my 2 year old enjoyed the crunch.  They reminded me of the corner pieces of baked brownies.  That&#39;s the best part!\n",
  "Loving the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle sample I got to try for free thanks to Swaggable. It had the great taste of of brownie without the mess. It has the look and feel of a potato chip but in brownie form. I would definitely buy this again. I can&#39;t wait to try the other varieties of this product!\n",
  "I had never heard of Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle until I got a free trial sample from Swaggable, and I don&#39;t know how I ever survived without them. THESE ARE SIMPLY AMAZING!!! I knew these would be good as soon as I saw the picture on the package, but I must say they exceeded my greatest expectations! They are rich and chocolately, like the best chocolate chip brownies you will ever eat. If that wasn&#39;t enough, they are light, crispy and crunchy, just like nut brittle. These are so sinfully decadent and will leave you wanting more, more, MORE! Eating these reminds me of snacking on the crunchy brownie crumbs from the bottom of the pan! I must admit, one morning I ate these for breakfast with my coffee, and the combination tasted just like coffee beans covered with chocolate! What a great way to wake up in the morning! I would highly recommend that everyone give Shelia G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle a try. You will not regret crunching into one of these tasty treats, and your taste buds will thank you as they dance with delight!!\n",
  "I was very surprised by how great these were. The only bad thing is that they were a little too sweet!\n",
  "I really love the Brownie Brittle. This was very tasty and I was really surprised by the amoiunt of chocolate chips in each piece. It taste just like a brownie except it had major crunch and half the calories. I would most definitely buy this.\n",
  "I think Sheila G read my mind!  I have ALWAYS wanted the edge of any brownies or cookie bars.  I LOVED this brittle.  I love how thin the brittle is and that every bite had chocolate in it.  I am thinking about giving the brittle as Christmas gifts, becasue I really think it has a gourmet twist to it.  I don&#39;t think anyone would be lieve that you can buy them at Walmart!\n",
  "They were very good. Could have been a little sweeter but I still loved them.\n",
  "I got my brownie brittle in the mail yesterday..couldnt wait to try it! I took one bite and fell in love! I ate the whole bag!!! Yummmmmm!!!!",
  "Okay, straight up: Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle is the BOMB. Amazing chocolate flavor in a crunchy chip texture that satifies a cookie craving like you wouldn&#39;t believe, and at a calorie count that doesn&#39;t ruin your day. I also discovered that if you aren&#39;t into the crunch, if you leave the bag open, they soften up to a more brownie like texture.\n",
  "Love it Love it Love it\n\nI was almost certain that I was not going to be receiving this product since it stated a month a go that I was getting it soon in the mail. When it arrived I was skeptikal about trying because it was so broken up. But that didnt stop me from trying it. And it is an A PLUS snack for chocolate lovers. My hisband enjoyed it and even the kids too. The bag is big enough for all of us to share so it is on the top of my snacks to recommend.\n",
  "As I never received my sample, I am basing my review on the concept of the sample and not my own personal experience.  I was most definitely looking forward to trying this product and was very disappointed that I never received it, despite having contacted Swaggable.  \n\nAt any rate, this is a super fun idea that I hope to see in stores near me soon.  Great for snacking and great for car trips, etc with kids!  I can imagine the texture to be something like the crispy corners of a brownie that cooks a little bit too long (my favorite part).  And I bet it goes great with coffee or even a glass of milk.  \n\nHopefully my next product doesn&#39;t get lost in transit, as I so wanted to be a part of this; however, I didn&#39;t want to miss out the chance to offer at least some insight based on the concept.  Thanks for including me in this sampling.  \n",
  "I LOVED THIS PRODUCT.\n\nI am one of the biggest brownie lovers that I know... so much so that I&#39;ve been known to eat just the batter (sick I know, but I can&#39;t help myself lol). Often times, products that claim to be brownie taste very artificial, nothing like a real brownie. But this taste exactly like the corner edge of a pan of brownies. Very authentic. I recieved the chocolate chip flavor of brownie brittle, but I&#39;m excited to try the other flavors as well. I would have given it a five star overall, but I thought that the product is a bit pricey for the serving size (on their website a 2-pack 4 oz bag is $10.95 ... although still a bit expensive, you&#39;d do better buying the 16 oz bag for $12.95)\n\nI think swaggable offering a coupon and allowing us to try 2 bags of the products was simply wonderful. I will be repurchasing, sharing and recommending this product. This stuff is the real deal... take it from a foodie, I&#39;m telling you it is worth the try. You&#39;ll love it!\n",
  "These are amazing, the crispy and the full flavor are wonderful.  This was a great product to try and I am officially hooked on them!\n",
  "I was pleasantly surprised by the Brownie Brittle -chocolate chip because I&#39;d never had anything like it before and the idea of brownie corners baffled me somewhat, but I really liked them. They do taste like a cookie version of a brownie and there size of the snack is very good. I was never left thinking there weren&#39;t enough in the single bags. They do have a lot of chocolate chips! which is a winner with me. When I opened the bag, I promise you all my friends within a 2 meter radius turned to look at me and asked what I was eating, the brittle looked so good they couldn&#39;t help but want to try some. I think that&#39;s what I liked the most, you could tell this was a good quality product from every angle. The packaging was pretty nice, the brittle was also nicely shapped and it didn&#39;t show up at my door all cracked or just dusty like I&#39;ve had some other snacks come in.  This company really wasn&#39;t stingy with their product and I would sincerely recommend it to others!\n",
  "OK lets just say I love this product.As soon as I cracked that bag open I was on my way to Safeway to buy more. My daughter fought me for the last crumb,the taste was super good. I am a fan and so are my friends and family thank you for sharing a sweet treat I really liked.",
  "Only thing I didnt like about chocolate chip brownie brittle is its too sweet",
  "These are really cool! What an interesting concept! They taste great and they are crunchy with a not too sweet chocolate flavor. I love the tiny chocolate chips!",
  "Really eat idea and these taste great! The kids love them and so does the husband. It is a very easy snack to grab and very fulfilling.",
  "Whats not to like?! It is a bag full of the best parts of a brownie pan, the edges. The flavor is very chocolately, especially with the added chocolate chips. The pieces are crunchy but not break your teeth hard. Almost the consistency of a wafer more than a brittle. Cant wait to buy more! My daugther and niece loved them too! And with all natural ingredients, its a snack you dont mind them having once in awhile. ",
  " \n\nl love a snack  treat that&#39;s chocolately,crunchy and delicious, and so light that you have to watch how much you&#39;re eating because it&#39;s so good that you keep popping peices of it in your mouth. I tried the Sheila G&#39;s Toffee Crunch Brownie Brittle  previously while out shopping at Bed, Bath & Beyond one day , but when I received the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle one from Swaggable I said Hey, this is now my favorite go to flavor from the brand. If you like chocolate, if you like brownies, if you like cookies, I highly recommend this product.\n\n \n",
  "I love this stuff :) yummy! Its so hard to find in stores though , thats the only downside :/",
  "These are amazing! I received two bags from Swaggable, complimentary for testing, and planned on giving one to my mom to try...then I tried them! She&#39;s just gonna have to buy her own :) They are amazing! So crunchy and chocolaty. I&#39;m a very picky eater and love my brownies to be dense and gooey not fluffy like cake. So these were right up my alley. My daughter loves them and at only 120 calories a serving so guilt free!\n",
  " I was SO excited to try Brownie Brittle and I was also expecting to be let down. I figured there was no way to mimic the most amazing part of a brownie. Too good to be true. I just ripped into a bag and was pleasantly surprised. The Texture was a bit different than I was expecting. It is definintely more of a cracker type feeling when you bit it rather than the chewyness of a brownie. I know the entire point is to be like the crisp edges of a brownie, but it is stil.... different. I think the difference is that the edges of brownies still have SOME moisture, but these have none at all. That being said, these things are delicious and I can&#39;t stop eating them. They are so light and crunchy, yet packed with all of the flavor of a delicious brownie. The brownie taste is like that of a homemade batch from mom, not like a pack of twinkies or ding dongs. Yay brownie brittle. I can&#39;t wait to buy more with the discount! Thank you!\n",
  "This product was super yummy.  Tasted like brownies, but was brittle and crunchy.  It was like eating all edges, which in my humble opinion, is one of the best parts of the brownie!  Lots of chocoloate chips and chocolate flavor.  They were almost too crumbly, though.  There were some sizeable pieces, but by the time I finished eating them, there was way too much crumbled powdery pieces in the bottom of the bag.\n",
  "This is the best thing after homemade brownies. The chocolate chip brownie brittle was delicious and mess free. I loved the amount of chocolate chips in every piece of brittle.I am amazed of the brownie taste. Guilt free snacking. I totally recommend this. I am definitely going to add this to my shopping list. This satisfied my chocolate brownie cravings.",
  "I know you shouldn&#39;t focus on calories but have you seen the calorie information on Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle? You could pretty much eat an entire bag and feel zeo guilt! I do not know how she packs so much delicious flavor in this low calorie brownie! Brownie Brittle is a crispy crunchy chocolate filled cookie/crackier/brownie. I&#39;ve thrown it on ice cream, on top of brownies and in cookie mix. Yes - I&#39;ve used Brownie Brittle even as a topping! Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle is great on the go and I like the zip lock bag carrier. I would totally recommend this to anyone that loves chocolate but worries about gaining too much weight. \n",
  "These were very good! I was impressed because I wasn&#39;t sure what to think at first. But I love trying new snacks and I love chocolate and brownies so I figured, why not. I think &#39;cookie crisp&#39; is the perfect description for them. Fits way better than &#39;brittle&#39;, because I was excpecting something really hard like peanut brittle, just chocolate flavored lol. The chocolate flavor is quite good and there is a good amount of real chocolate chips in each square &#39;cookie crisp&#39;. They are just the perfect size for snacking. And the bags (I got two 2oz bags) had quite a few little brownie crisps in them, and hardly any were broken or crushed!\n\nIt had the perfect amount of crunch too. I don&#39;t like snacks that are too crunchy because it hurts my teeth but these were just like slighty crispy cookies, hence the description on the bag. Very good flavor, not too sweet, but chocolately. Tasted nice and fresh, I didn&#39;t taste any &#39;staleness&#39;. They kind of melt in your mouth, really. They&#39;re not super thin or thick. I would say they were the thickness of an average square cracker.  Enjoyed these a lot! I would buy and reccommend. They&#39;re also made from natural ingredients which is a bonus. And they don&#39;t have a lot of calories either, if you&#39;re concerned with that kind of thing. So, they make a great overall snack for pretty much anybody who loves chocolate I think.\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Chocoalte Chip Brownie Brittle is so yummy. You just can&#39;t stop eating it. It&#39;s light and it has a really deep chocolate flavor. If you are crazy for chocolate like me you have got to try it! I thought I could just eat a couple of pieces but I could not put the bag down.\n",
  "These were amazing, they tasted just like brownies and I loved that they were always crunchy! ",
  "This is just the right combination of crunchy, chocolate, and sweet.  Has pieces of chocolate chips in it.  Just a few pieces will satisfy your craving.  This is going to become a staple at my house.  YUMMY!!!\n",
  "My children all like this better than I did (which is all that matters isn&#39;t it?). The chocolate had a milder flavor than I would have prefered but I like a darker chocolate flavor. All three of my kids ..age 12 to 16 loved the flavor and the texture which was somewhere between crunchy and chewy. I would definitely buy this for them if I could find it in stores..if not I just checked and I can get it from Amazon (free shipping with Prime membership). Thanks again Swaggable for a great find.\n",
  "These were super tasty! I wasn&#39;t sure what to think with the name, but they were really yummy. The crisp bite and the full-chocolatey taste was the perfect combination. Plus, as a hot item by WeightWatchers.com, it&#39;s nice to have a snack that I&#39;m not going to feel guilty about!\n",
  "I was incredibly surprised at how great these tasted!!!  I love them!  So I happened to make Ghiradelli Brownies right before these came in the mail for me to try out, of course all of the fresh baked brownies were devoured before opening one of the two free snack bags of this brownie brittle I got.  I was aching for another soft brownie but Shelia G&#39;s  Brittle was just as good if not better.  I cannot believe I  have not stumbled upon this delicious treat any sooner, it&#39;s great!  I love the way it tastes when I let it sit and melt in my mouth - so delicious!\n",
  "These are simply addicting! The flavor of the chocolate chip is strong, without being overpowerful. If you&#39;re a chocolate fan, you&#39;ll love these. And the fact that they&#39;re 120 calories/ounce is even better. There are a lot of 100 calorie packs out there that just don&#39;t satisfy my sweet tooth, but I&#39;m now on the hunt to find these in a local store & try the other varities as well. I shared them in my office and before I knew it, they were gone!\n",
  "It was delicious! Seriously, so good. \n",
  "My husbands 1st words when trying these were OH MY GOD! These are soooo good. For a brittle I was expecting them to be really hard and they are not. They have just the right amout of chrunkyness to them. I would highly recommend these to all the chocolate lovers out there. They are pretty chocolatly.\n",
  "It&#39;s brownies! It&#39;s brittle! It&#39;s Brownie Brittle!! This stuff is as we say in the south so good makes you wanna slap yo mama. So here is the break down it&#39;s a VERY thin crunchy brownie in some awesome flavors (mint chocolate chip, salted caramel, toffee crunch and chocolate chip). The mint chocolate chip is out of this world good-my favorite, the bag has been put out of view of the rest on my family and I try to allow myself 1 piece a day.\nBut be prepared you will want to eat the whole bag so have a jug of milk on hand and ENJOY!\n\nMy only issue was it&#39;s hard to measure out a serving size in bits and pieces.\n",
  "What an amazing creation brownie brittle in chocolate chip by Sheila G. The joy of cookies and brownies unite with a rich homemade taste that packs major crunch! Made with all natural ingrediants with a low calorie count of 120 with a serving size of 4 delisious squares. Love the corner piece of a homemade brownie? Well brownie brittle brings you just that, the great taste and crunch of your favorite brownie! As a home baker and mom the homemade taste and richness stands out in brownie brittle which can be enjoyed anywhere! \n",
  "This has got to be the best and only brittle I ever tasted.  The flavor is great, the chocolate chips were many, and I liked the richness to it.  Plus its my favorite dessert.",
  "I liked the brownie brittle quite well, it was chocatly and chrisp. I however did not really like the texture. Maybe because I really like soft brownies and not the corners.. overall it was good though\n",
  "This was a fabulous full sized sample! What a treat this was too. It was almost like a cookie, but lighter with a big chocolately taste that you will love. It&#39;s perfect to have with a cup of coffee or tea - morning,noon or night! You will especially like this treat if you love the crispy edges when you bake a pan of brownies!!! It was light, crispy and tasty! I highly recommend this treat!\n",
  "tasted really well nice flavor. i would recommend to everyone. my kids loved them\n",
  "As a brownie-lover and also the one who calls dibs on the corner piece, I thoroughly enjoyed Brownie Brittle™ snacks by Sheila G. They only have 120 calories per ounce, and are absolutely delicious! I loved the crsipy texture while getting that rich chocolate taste. This is now a snacking staple at my house!\n",
  "When I first saw this I was skeptical because brownies are rich and the taste can be overwhelimg. This Brownie Brittle is way better than an actual brownie. The brownie taste is there and it&#39;s so fresh just in a crunchy form. Honestly, I only ate the top of the brownies that were crunchy so this Brownie Brittle is by far the best thing I&#39;ve ever tasted.\n\nI am buying more!\n",
  "I recieved these chocolate chip brownie brittle from Sheila G&#39;s. I thought my middle son would love them, I am not a big fan of the edge of the brownie, I am more of a fresh baked, middle of the brownie kind of person! So, I waited and waited to try them, thinking I wouldn&#39;t like them. I seen them at a store I shopped at, so I came home and decided to try thrm out. My first bite I thaought was kinda bland, but then I ended up eating the whole bag! Good thing they sent 2 so my son can have some of the other bag!! They are crunchy and chooclatey, and delicious!!! I diffenantly would buy these and recommend them to friends and family, even to people at the store standing there debating on buying them!\n",
  "It&#39;s like eating a corner brownie every time! Great flavor! I love brownies and brownie brittle is such a great idea! I love to snack on it. I&#39;d definitely recommend it. \n",
  "I was pleasanty surprised by this product.  At first site I was a little skeptical....not that it did not look appealing, but it did not look quite like brittle to me, but just a flat brownie.  However, the taste made up for that.  The chocolate taste was not artificial tasting, it really did taste like eating a chocolate brownie.  I would absolutely purchase this product for myself and others.  And for recommending this, I would not hesitate recommending and a more healthy, but good tasting snack.  LOVED IT!\n",
  "This brittle is amazing and tastes exactly like eating the edge of a brownie. It is in low calorie and fulfills my cravings for the real deal good when consume with milk.\n",

  "This was a delicious & unique treat for the whole family! Everyone enjoyed it so much that it did not last very long. I would like to try new flavors & plan to buy more!",
  "All I can say is WOW WOW WOW What a Burst of rich chocolate in my mouth, my kids evern fought over this product,the rich taste of this crisp brownie brittle would be be an awesome desert after any meal or just alone, next we will try the mint\n",
  "I really enjoy the brownies brittle.  My 4 year enjoy them too.  The little brittles at the bottom of the bag I sprinkle on my ice cream, and it was really good.\n",
  "Wow Sheila G.&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is delicious!!  I don&#39;t feel guilty consuming it because it only has 120 calories, I think I found my guilty pleasure!  Thanks for the free sample Swaggable, will definitly buy some more Brownie Brittle!\n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is really good.  I like the crunchy texture but amazed at how much it tastes just like real brownies.  My daughter really like them too.",

  "I absolutely loved my Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle!\n\nI can&#39;t get enough of these and am so happy that I sampled them.  They are delicious and satiate my taste for brownies, without having to get out the batter.  I&#39;m also happy that they&#39;re all natural.  I almost can&#39;t believe it, they&#39;re so delicious!\n\nFurthermore, they&#39;re so ORIGINAL!  This is truly a unique snack.  It&#39;s different from anything I&#39;ve ever tried.  I hope it becomes more popular and readily available!\n",
  "I really enjoyed these brownie chips. These are an awesome snack for sweettooths like myself.  I was a little hesistant to try them at first because I thought they were going to be hard, but literally melted in my mouth.  They are delicious.  I like the fact that they are made with natural ingredients.  My boyfriend really enjoyed them as well...and he is a picky snacker!  So that has to count for something too.  I would definitely recommend these! One of the downsides is that they are kinda hard to find and not sold in stores I usually shop at.\n",
  "This is an awesome treat. The flavor was fantastic and fresh. The only thing is I am having issues trying to find this at my local grocery store s.",
  "Really love this. The  taste is awesome. Kids love it too! No mess with cooking brownies:) \n",
  "OMG yes y&#39;all these brownie brittle snacks were so divine taste just like brownies when you get them out the oven very fresh and we all know the best part of them all the corner peice but only the who bag is the corner piece I am so going to repurchase these I hope that they sell them in my area I&#39;m HOOKED\n",
  "I LOVED these! They were Delicious! My kids tore them up! The crispy crunchy edges are the best part of a brownie! We always wind up fighting over them! Having these solved all problems! I loved the flavor that the chocolate chips gave the brownie brittle. \n",
  "So I dont like to right bad reviews butI ddidnt care for this much at all.  My kids like it off course because its sweets.  My husband didnt care for it either.  To me it tastes like a flat chocolate cookie.  If you like brownies that are flat and crispy then you would like this.  ",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle I received to sample from Swaggable was so delicious. I love brownies but never gave much thought to outside edges. However, I absolutely fell in love with this snack. It was very decadent and extremely chocolatey, yet also crispy. Just the thing to satisfy the hunger of any chocolate lover!\n",
  "One word ONOLICIOUS (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Onolicious). You gotta like or enjoy crunchy brownies. Taste exactly like the soft and chewy kind just thin and crunchy...and light. Watch out though because you could eat a whole bag and not even realize it!\n",
  "I&#39;m not really a crispy brownie edge kinda gal, so I really didn&#39;t have very high hopes for the Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. Boy was I suprised when I tried them. They are absolutely delicious. I definitely recommend giving them a try if you haven&#39;t already. \n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle is so deliciously addictive! I loved it! It&#39;s really cruchy and delicious, and really nails that real brownie taste. It sort of tastes like yummy brownie flavored cookies. Such a fun snack that&#39;s good for you and super tasty! I received the chocolate chip flavor to try, and now I can&#39;t wait to go out and buy the toffee! I have definitely found a new fave snack!\n",
  "This product was amazing it was like eating chocolate flavored chips can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors\n",
  "I really didnt know what to expect from Brownie Brittle. I had never heard of it.  I love brownies but I usually like them chewie. Oh man was I wrong about that.  This brownie Brittle is delicious.  I dont know how they fit so much flavor in that little crispy chip.  And there are little chocolate chips in there as an added surprise.  This is now a staple in my house.  ",
  "Loved the crunch.  Was so impressed how relatively few calories they were for such a seemingly indulgent snack.  Really fun and tasty!",
  "Delightfully Delish!They are thee best part of any brownie...the crunchy endish part with savory chocolate chips!They are little bite sized sqares of great big brownie flavor,we loved them and you will too!\n",

  "This was the first time I tried this products and was so happy with how good it tasted! It was just like eating a brownie in flavor, with a nice cruch, good texture appealing color, it left a good fun after taste. It lovd how it was package, in a resealable bag, keeping them fresh until I wanted more thank you for letting me try this it was fun anf now a family favortive\n",
  "Tastes like a brownie flavored cookie! There are pieces in the bag that are big and small and 1 oz is 100 calories. It definitely satisfies that sweet tooth. :)\n",
  "Shelia G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Britle is like a drug.  You can&#39;t stop eating it once you start. :) This is so much better than eating a regular brownie if you are trying to count calories and eat healthier. We shouldn&#39;t deprive ourselves, that is why this brownie is so good, you feel like you are indulging, but you aren&#39;t. Can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors. \n",
  "When I received these I must admit I didnt think they would be that great..but wow this brownie brittle packs some serious flavor! I had Evey intention to blog about this product but once I opened the bag I seriously ate them all. Lol \nI love the super crispy texture and the way they almost melt in your mouth.\nMost of all they taste exactly like a batch of homemade brownies.\nI cant wait to stock up on these as the boyfriend loved them also...now I just need to refrain from eating the entire bag.",
  "I love shis lowfat tasty dessert which crunches like a chip or cracker. Very satisfying \n",
  "I would have loved to try it but never got my sample in the mail so i dont really know what to say. \n",
  "These were way more tasty than I first thought they would be. When I first read the back about the back story on how these were created it really sparked my interest. When I tried the first one, I could not put it down! It was much more delicious than I first thought. It takes like the best crispy part of the brownie that everyone fights over to get. I would most certainly recomend this item to anyone who loves fun, chocolately, brownie treats! \n",
  "My family loved the brownie brittle. The crunchy brownie. My son heating the browine in the mirowave and added whipp cream he really love. We also added this brownie brittle in milk shakes. He would have ate the whole bag himself if Ilet him. Will buy for stocking stuffers. This is a wonderful snack\n",
  "These things are delicious! The kids and I dipped these cookie brownies in milk and I can honestly say I havent tasted anything this good in a while.",
  "This was a very interesting take on brittle. I loved The indulgent chocolate flavor and how it was so crispy. The convienient zipper seal kept them fresh and crisp until the last bite, so that was an added plus. The family really loved them too! They enjoyed dipping them in milk before eatting them.\n",
  "This was so delicious. My entire family loved it. It was sweet but not to sweet and it had lots of crunch. Such a great snack for those that love brittle but also chocolate. I can&#39;t wait to purchase other flavors.\n",
  "This was a fun new product to try and they were so yummy!",
  "Very delicous! To be honest once you start, you cant stop!  They are very good and I was impressed. I did not think I would think much of these, but I really enjoyed them! I would recommend these to everyone!\n",
  "i have to say that i was really surprised that the sample i recieved was not a tiny little packet that was never enough of to truly decide if it was a good, decent, delicious or otherwise product. so i was thrilled by the large bag of Sheila G&#39;s brownie brittle! it actually took my back to the day when my mom made cookies for Christmas. she made a very thin brownie mix no taller than approx 1/8 inch high and covered it with walnuts and baked them in the oven. they came out crispy and was always the favorite that everyone wanted. thanks swaggable for a great product and one that there was enough of to do an actual objective report on. also thanks for the coupon but i am trying to find a retailer who sells this as i would love to buy some more! if you have a chance to buy this please do yourself a favor and get them! :)\n",
  "I really enjoyed the brownie bites. The chocolate flavorr was very rich and good. I would and did recommend this product and was gald I had a chance to try it. I will buy this in the future.\n",
  "Yum Yum!  LOVE IT!  My brother totally took Sheila&#39;s chocolate chip brownie brittle bag right out of my hands and ran away with.  It was delicious.  Was at Sam&#39;s club and bought a bag of Sheila&#39;s brownie brittle with toffee just for me alone.  Perfect to have at all times, especially when reading a book. Indulgence.\n",
  "These were absolutely incredible! I&#39;m always a crispy cookie eater, so this was perfect. The chocolate was rich but because of the crispiness, it didn&#39;t feel as heavy as a whole brownie would have. In fact, I&#39;ve been looking for them ever since and just haven&#39;t found them for sale. Edit: Hmmm...looks like there is only one Safeway near me that carries them, according to their website...looks like I know where I&#39;ll be stopping on my way home...\n",
  "This showed up at my door, i forgot about it...opened the box and was a little confused, until i tried it and fell in love. This treat is so light and delicious. I opened a bag sampled it, went back later for more and the whole bag was gone, my family ate it that fast. And then i went to try the second, opened it and gone...I think right there that shows the deliciousness of this product, not only is it amazing and low in calorie, you cant even keep it for a day becase someone will eat it. I cant wait to go buy more. \n",
  "i liked the taste of the chocolate chip brownie brittle well enough but it was far too crunchy for my liking but if you like the crispy edges of a brownie these are the snack for you :)\n",
  "I expected not to love these but they were AMAZING.  They were perfect!!! YUM!\n",
  "These things are absolutely addictive! Tastes just like a brownie without all the calories but the satisfying crunch of a chip\n",
  "Upon recieving this product I could not stop eating it! I&#39;m usually a fan of the soft part of the brownie vs the crunchy but this product was just amazing!\n",
  "This chocolate chip brownie brittle is delicious! Not only does it curve the craving when you need something sweet but is also its small enough for you not to over do it. It took me two weeks to finish the two bag samples. Taste just like a brownie! Awesome product! I will definitely buy it in the near future.\n",
  "Tried the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle a Brittle that is low in calories. I normally don&#39;t like Britlle at all but this was so yummy and nice to know that it&#39;smade with natural ingredients.\n",
  "It actual are the edge pieces of Brownie. I guess it was semi hard that why they called brittle.the taste was alright even though I keep tasting a aftertaste. But it was a creative idea \n ",

  "i was not a fan of this at all! i didnt like the flavor or the texture of the chocolate\n",
  "So delicious, I never had brownie brittle so, this is very intersting and cute. It very thin like a brownie chip but still good and melty in your mouth. Nice amount but can be alttle dry...taste even better with milk!\n",
  "Wow, I am in love with Brownie Brittle, this is my new all time favorite sweet treat. I have told so many people about this amazingly yummy product. I love it, so sweet and super crunchy and so very chocolately!\n",
  "It was just okay. I was hoping for more of a chewy brownie corner. These are just cruchy and flat. They are great crumbled with ice cream. They were good, just not what I was expecting. \n",
  "This product was way better than I expected. My whole family loved it the flavor was great and it was easy to eat and didnt have big pieces.\n",
  "Chocolate Chip brownie brittle has been enjoyed so much by my children that I have even searched for it in the stores. Totally LOVING the fact that Sheila G.&#39;s brownie brittle is made with NATURAL ingredients! I for one am all for natural products for my family. My guy said that the only thing that would make this brownie brittle better is a cold glass of milk. I gave one bag to my sister in law, whom also loved it! \n",
  "The Sample of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle that I recieved was awesome! It was definatly different than any other snack or cookie that I have ever tried. My husband and son enjoyed them also. I would buy this snack if I saw it in the grocery store.\n",

  "You have never tasted anything like this before! I like to call it a brookie, but whatever you call it the crunchy, chocolately, cripsy brittle is like nothing you&#39;ve ever had before! You can buy a big bag at Sam&#39;s Club! We get one just about every week! If you haven&#39;t tried Sheila G&#39;s, I highly recommend you do!\n",
  "The kids really enjoyed these as a quick and yummy after school snack. They are crunchy just like the corners of a pan of brownies. Will probably repurchase these once in a while for the kiddosto enjoy - I am not a big  fan of crunchy foods in general. \n",
  "This was something completely new and different to me. I am a chocoholic and absolutely love brownies. Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle easily cures my cravings for sweet chocolate deliciousness. I am a diabetic and was able to enjoy a small piece daily without my blood sugar levels being affected. The flavor is rich, just like a dedacent brownie batter. My husband also enjoyed this snack very much. The only down side, I can&#39;t find it in any stores near me to purchase it.\n",
  "These were the most delicious brownies Ive had in a while. They were super chocolatey, crispy and crunchy. I definitely was sad when both bags were finished. Im glad I was able to try these and have bought more bags since. A great sweet snack for everyone.",
  "Taste absolutely great, cure little packaging that you can take any where! I definitely recommend getting these if you like brownies with crunch!!",
  "I absolutely loved the brownie brittle! This is such a unique product I haven&#39;t come across before. I enjoyed the rich chocolate flavor and it was perfectly crispy to the very last bite. I could see this being a fantastic ice cream topper but honestly once I openned the bag, its never gonna last long enough to actually find out if its a good ice cream topper! I think these would also make a fantastic gift if you could keep yourself from eating it long enough to give it as a gift. Basically, just try it for yourself and you&#39;ll see. YUM!\n",
  "Shelia G&#39;s Brownie Brittle is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!!! They taste delicious but I dare you to just eat one...\n",
  "I was so happy to recieve a full sized sample in the mail of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle! It was plenty to allow my whole family to try! This stuff is SO good! Tastes exactly like the yummy corner piece of homemade brownies! I have been looking for Shelia G&#39;s brownie brittle in my local grocery aisles since receiving the product to try from swaggable and have no yet found it.

  "Ohhhhhhh The yumminess in this bag is SCRUMPTIOUS! Sure went fast as soon as I set it on the table for everyone in the house to try!!!\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle is delicious. It&#39;s super crunchy - just like the edges of brownies (corner pieces!). Not only is it delcious but it only has 120 calories. You can indulge w/o guilt - perfect!\n\nI&#39;ve already bought more! \n",
  "Delicious!! Yummy! I love those. It tastes so good. I am sure I will buy it. :)\n",
  "It taste relaly good liek brownie! It was crispy and liked how it is low calorie and kosher.\n",
  "I was so excited to be able to try Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle (thanks Swaggable!), and I was NOT disappointed! The smell was definitely the first thing that hit me when I opened the package. It smelled like fresh baked brownies, all ooey gooey chocolatey! Honestly, if you don&#39;t want to share DO NOT open them around anyone!! Go to your room, lock your door, and maybe (just to be on the safe side) hide in your closet before you open them. They should seriously come with a warning in big bold letters! I did not know this, and I opened them with my niece in the room. I am slightly ashamed to admit that we devoured half the bag together before either of us could get control of ourselves. The Brownie Brittle is just THAT GOOD!! Thin and crispy with enough chocolate chips to satisfy anyone, and they taste exactly like the crispy corners of a pan of brownies. I couldn&#39;t have been happier because this has always been my favorite part. Yes, I AM one of those people who will eat the four corners first before going for the edges - never the middle. Even better? If you&#39;re on a diet or just watching what you eat this is a perfect snack ... as long as you have some self-control. Eat a piece here and there and you&#39;re good. It will satisfy a craving for something sweet or something chocolatey, and it&#39;s made with natural ingredients. It all leaves me very eager to eat more of the chocolate chip ones and definitely try the other flavors.\n",
  "so yummy!!  crispy and toasty just like the edges of a brownie (my fave). these are so good!  I ate the WHOLE bag!\n",
  "I loved my Chocalate Chip Brownie Brittle.  It was so good.  I felt like I was eating a crispy brownie.  All the flaver was there and I couldn&#39;t stop eating the bag.  I love that the the bag only had 120 calories.  This is definitely one the best new snacks I have tried.\n",
  "i didnt like this product the taste was aweful. I would not buy this product.\n",
  "I thought this Brownie Brittle was great.  It was the perfect snack to satisfy that craving for chocolate bakery.  With my busy schedule I dont always have the time to bake and it was great to have this on hand.  I will definitely purchase this product.   An additional bonus to this product is  my son has a severe Peanut allergy and we are always looking for snacks that he can have.  This was a winner!  ",
  "Love teh crispy texture like peanut butter. If you like crispy cookies you will love this!\n",
  "These are absolutly genius !! I am super picky and doubted these alot even put off trying them for a while but when I did ... It was like heaven in my mouth (honest to god)  \n\nSo so so  perfect, different , light, and delicious . I didn&#39;t even know they were a weight watchers food until I seen it today online.. which is insane to me ! btw  these are NOT super crunchy like peanut brittle , I think brownie crisps defines it a bit better.\n\nOk, just imagine the most amazing brownie you have ever tasted ...because that is what this tastes like exactly!  I&#39;m such a fan of these and so is my family ... I am even going to make christmas baskets this year with bags of brownie brittle and cocoa to give as gifts!! \n\nps - the full size choc. chips are also huge perk!!\n",
  "I have to say I was EXTREMELY excited to have been chosen to review this product Brownie Brittle, but was very disappointed when I opened up my box, and somehow the bag had been opened, and spilled all through the box...and there was white stuff all over the Brownie Brittle....so I didn&#39;t get to try this product, and I had posted on Swaggable&#39;s facebook page about what had happened with no reply..VERY DISAPPOINTED\n",
  "Great snack for the whole family. Packed full of chocolaty flavor that everyone will love.\n",
  "I was totally excited to try the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle when I was invited. I&#39;m a lover or the edge pieces of brownies, don&#39;t get me wrong I love the chewy middle pieces too but there is something about those edges. When I first opened the pack of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle I thought there is no way these taste like brownie edges. To my suprise they do taste like brownie edges. They have the all the brownie flavor that you would expect and they are very satisfying to the sweet tooth. I shared my sample with my family so that I could find out what they thought about the flavor, everyone in my family loved the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle.  This Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle woud make a wonderful snack paired with a tall glass of ice cold milk. Needless to say I will most definitely be purchasing the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle in the future.\n",
  "Yum!!!  This is the BEST snack that I have ever had!!  Not too much chocolate flavor, but just enough to cure that chocolate craving. I ate the whole bag in one sitting :)\n",
  "First id like to say thank you to Shiela Gs for the full size sample of your delicious Brownie Brittle. My 5&7 yr. old boy and girl loved it. We as a family devoured it. We ate alone as a snack. We ate it as a side for dessert. We ate it as a topping for our icecream. Your brownie brittle perfectly satisfied that pesky sweet tooth. I told everyone I know how great an innovative this product really is and that my family couldnt get enough. Thank you once again to Swaggable and Shiela Gs for the opprtunity to try such a delicious treat. I would definately purchase this brownie brittle.",
  "OMG! These were the most amazing things I have ever enjoyed. I wasn&#39;t sure how I was going to like them at first since brownies are suppose to be nice, soft and very moist but once I took that first bite I was Hooked! Very sad when the bag was all gone too. If I could find these in the store I would buy them with no hesetation. \n",
  "Ok so I was skepticle at first to try this once I received it, but after the first bite I was hooked.  These snacks are so good and actually smell and taste like a real brownie.  I&#39;m eating them right now as I type this lol!!! The texture is just right and the nutritional value isn&#39;t bad at all for a chocolaty snack.  Overall, I will be purchasing the Brownie Brittle in the future. Thanks Sheila G&#39;s!!!\n",
  "Brownie Brittle is great when you want a sweet snack. Crispy and chocolately. I really want to try the mint version, unfortunately the one place that stocks BB only carries the originial chocolate chip version.\n",
  "Great tasting and REALLY kewl looking.  Was unlike anything that I have tried before.  Would make a great pairing with a nice hot cup of coffee, tea, or milk.\n",
  "This stuff was SOOOOOO GOOOD! I am now on the hunt to find these. They taste just as good as regular brownies!\n",
  "Sheila G’s Brownie Brittle was very good. The light and airy snack took me and my family by surprise, it was new and exciting. We had never experienced  a treat like this before. The rich brownie flavor danced on my taste buds while the crispness of it was a delight overall.   I was expecting a hard candy coated treat like traditional brittle but what I got instead was a treat I enjoyed much more. The only problem I had was there was not enough in the bag. \n",
  "I loved these. That are fresh and crunchy. I will purchase this product!",
  "I&#39;ve always been a fan of squishy, soft cookies and brownies so when given the opp to try out Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle I took it to try something different for a change. I did like the fun, crispy texture. The chocolate was delish. I would recommend this for those looking for a crispy, sweet snack. Best part is that it fits in most diets so its a great snack to endulge with. Went very well with vanilla icecream!!\n",
  "This is a yummy yummy chocolate crunchy goodness snack if you like chocolate and crunchy goodness then this is the snack to get for yourself as a treat. you have to be careful though its pretty addictive this brownie brittle its hard to not eat a whole bag so you might want to get extra and maybe if a friend is lucky you might be willing to share some\n",
  "I was really impressed with this product. I really liked it and even shared it with friends they were amazed. I would definatly purchase this product. The look of it is different but the taste is AMAZING. \n",
  "Brownie Brittle melts in your mouth! Oh My Goodness! I shared one bag with my kids and they immediately wanted to open the second bag, yeah, NOPE. Try again next time kids, that one&#39;s mine! \n",
  "The Brownie Brittle is pretty good. Of course its not soft and chewy like brownies, but they are crunchy and have the flavor of my favorite part - the corners. If you are someone who likes the brownie corners then you will like this brownie brittle. They are chocolat-y and pretty tasty with baked in chocolate chips and no nuts. Plus the bag is reasealable, so it makes a good on the go snack. \n",
  "I wouldn&#39;t buy this product for myself.  I prefer the chewy middle pieces of the brownies.  If you&#39;re looking for something extremely sweet and you like a lot of crunch, this product is for you.  It might be good if you are just wanting to satisfy a sweet tooth while watching calories because I can&#39;t imagine anyone being able to eat an entire ounce and reaching 120 calories. \n",
  "This brownie brittle is really good, it taste just like a brownie but with crunch like a cookie. Everyone in the house loved exspecially my kids. I will be keeping an eye out in the store for this.\n",
  "best thing ever! love this part of the brownie. i have bought more of this. totally amazing!\n",
  "The bites were a bit too hard, but the flavor was full of chocolate. If it was a bit softer I can see myself eating this all the time!",
  "These taste better than homemade brownies and\n\nare conveniently designed cookie style.  So they are very\n\ntasteful and great for on the go.   Can&#39;t live without these\n\nif you are a cookie and brownie fan.  Crunchy, chocolatey, and\n\ndelicious.\n",
  "Thois product surprised me. It was so good! I thought at first it might not be but the texture, taste and even smell were perfect! I actually am looking for them on the shelf next time I am shopping for food!\n",
  "My husband and two teenagers all said they thought they were great. Only thing is they usually empty a container of great withing a few hours. Unfortunately these Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittles never disappeared completely. Truly great treats DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY in my house- especilly chocolate treats.\n\nThis leads me to believe they weren&#39;t as great as my families first impression had indicated. I felt this way myself. First impression...first few pieces, seemed great. Thought I&#39;d like em&#39; and would wanna eat bunch. After the eating first few pieces, I began to notice the texture wasn&#39;t as I&#39;d liked. Too thin, too dry, and too crisp. The bigger fatter pieces seemed better, but thoose were few and immediately gone. What was left wasn&#39;t very appealing to be honest. I&#39;d much rather eat a regular chocolate chip cookie, or cheap store bought brownie.\n\nThis is why the bag never was eatten completely. Not a great treat. Just a mediocre one. I personally woun&#39;t buy these. I probably would pass even if offered them anytime.\n",
  "These chocolate chip brownie brittle were so Yummy!!!! loved the smell and taste i and my family really enjoyed them i will be buying these in the future i highly recommend this product thanks \n",
  "OMG The sidewalks of heaven must be paved in this! ABSOLUTELY delicious, not a single complaint, we had the bag gone in like 3 min of opening it. I am going to be buying this for sure! Thank you so much for allowing me to try this product, it is so darn tasty! I RECOMMMEND TO ALL SWEET TOOTH HOLDERS!\n",
  "The chocolate chip brownie brittle was a ok snack for my kids. I would buy a different flavor for myself. ",
  "I&#39;m afraid my brother got to this first. He ate it all in one sitting and I never got to try it. But this is what I got out of him : Tastes more like cookies then a brownies. But the flavor is delicious! It is difficult to stop eating these... Obviously! \n",
  "i didnt really care for these it tasted like burnt brownie dough to me\n",
  "These were amazing! I didn&#39;t expect a lot from them as many things to me that are supposedly brownie flavored hav a funny taste to me. I sat and was working on my computer noshing on them and before I realized it I ate the whole bag! I saw them in stores near me and bought the toffee crunch version and they were also delicious! Another great thing about them is they are reasonably priced! \n",
  "So yummy! This is my new favorite snack. It is just the right amount of sweetness and everybite is the crunchy goodness of the brownie top!\n",
  "These were so good! I had to fight my boyfriend for them lol They were delicious and just the right portion size-although it would be easy to eat the whole bag in one sitting the are so good!\n",
  "OMG- what an amazing product! I could not believe that I had never tried these before. The taste was phenom! If you have never tried the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle- I highly reccommend that you do. It wasn&#39;t too heavy and the crispness of it was perfect. I have gotten 4 bags since trying it- it&#39;s that good!\n",
  "These were absolutely delicious! I never would have thought of a brownie chip, but they were truly delicious. I love that they are really protable too, they made for aperfect snack to send to school with my daughters. I&#39;ll definitely be looking out for these at stores near me!\n",
  "Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle was a delicious treat for my family.   I am a person that normally does not like the crunchy part of the brownie, but this was so much better.  The chocolate chips didn&#39;t get that nasty burnt taste that I had come to expect from crisp brownies.  I was not expecting to like it as much as I did.  I even grudgingly shared it with my kids who couldn&#39;t get enough either.  I would happily buy Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle.\nI wish I had this brownie brittle when I was making dessert as a chef. I can just imagine the reaction my Kahlua Mocha Fudge pie would have gotten if a piece of this crunchy brownie brittle was decorating the top.  Brownie Brittle would also make a great topping to a brownie sundae too. It is also delicious to snack alone. (my favorite way to eat it)\n",
  "After looking through other reviews I think I can safely say I must have gotten an off bag. Mine were rock hard, and a bit bitter. My sons said they tasted burnt to them. I have to admitt even rock hard they had a great scent, and it was a very generous sample. I&#39;d be willing to give the salted caramel a chance to see if my bag really was just a fluke. \n",
  "At first, I wasn&#39;t impressed. I guess it really just wasn&#39;t what I expected. I tried it again the next day, though, and couldn&#39;t stop eating it. It&#39;s really different from anything else. It&#39;s almost like brownie chips-- really crunchy and good!  Overall, I give it 4 stars because I&#39;m not craving it and running to the store for more, but it was a nice snack. My husband did actually go buy some more though, so he apparently really liked it!\n",
  "Love that this is all natural. Love the crunchiness and chocolatey-ness of the Brownie Brittle. I would definitely buy this product again! Yum!",
  "These were great and hit the spot at night when I needed something sweet to eat! And I didn&#39;t even have to make the brownies to get the best part of them!\n",
  "I absolutely loved these. They were so good I hid them from my children. I loved the brownie brittle . The crispy edges were just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.\n\n \n",
  "This was the best tasting Brittle ever! Couldn&#39;t put it down! Will have to buy!\n",
  "OMG! This products is absolutely delicious! I love the chocolate chips throughout the brownie pieces, even the small ones. Now that is dedication! I was so surprised to find that I really love Brownie Brittle more than brownies. I love that it is thin yet crunchy. I had this as a snack several times after work and not only was I full but I couldn&#39;t eat just one. I will be buying this from now on and I can&#39;t wait to find the Brownie Brittle with Salted Caramel. I will be a customer for life!\n",
  "chocolate chip brownie brittle is amazingly delicious. very rich in taste and crunchy.the size of the pieces in the bag are a good portion sizefor individual consumption. my 18 month old daughter enjoy them too. Ummy  to quote her exactly. the only negative thing I would say is the bag was empty to fast but I did go and purchase another bag.",
  "This was... Ok. It did have a flavor reminiscent of brownies. But the texture didnt make me feel like I was getting the coveted corner brownie. It made me feel like I was getting the scrapings from the pan after all the brownies are gone. Yes, the corner Brownie is my fave. I think of the edges as being shiny, chewy, with just a bit of crispiness. These were a crunchy, crumb-y  thing. I think think they would be ok if I wasnt expecting brownies. ",
  "The Cholclate Chip Brownie Brittle sample I recieived was SOOO yummy!!! I loved everything about this sample I got to try... What I found most enjoyable about the Cholclate Chip Brownie Brittle sample was how it tasted just like a brownie...it was amazing! The texture of &#39;brittle&#39; part of the brownie wasnt to brittle at all... It was hard enough to make a chrunch but not so hard that it breaks your teeth. With only 120 calories a serving its a great healthy snack.. You can really feel it has a gourment taste! The best part is its peanut-free, certified-Kosher, made with natural ingredients you cant beat that!!!   \n",
  "This was just great my children loved it and so did I to bad we ran out so now I have to go buy me a bag!\n",
  "I absolutely fell in love with Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle. The brownie tasted great and exaclty like the crispy crunchy edges of a rich gourmet brownie. This brownie was definitely an award winning brownie that goes down well with a tall cool glass of milk. I could finish a whole bag in one sitting and I can&#39;t believe that it is only 120 calories/ounce. I think the best part of this is that the brownie is made with natural ingredients! I received a free sample of Shelia G&#39;s Brownie Brittle for free to try and I would definitely recommend and buy it!\n",
  "Cool idea and great taste! Easy to travel with and not too sweet. I loved it.",
  "OMG!!! These Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle Blew my mind!. Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is the best to use on all kinds of things....Ice Cream, yogurt, shakes, pancakes, chocolate milk or all by themselves. I will now purchase Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle for the rest of my life and will introduce them to anyone who will listen. My entire family enjoyed them and requested that I go out and purchase them as soon as they were gone. \n",
  "When I recived my sample of brownie brittle unfortanetly the bag was cut open so I didnt trust eating it. I have yet to try them When they go on sale I will grab a bag Im just not willing to spend $4.50 on such a small bag and not know if it is worth it.\n",
  "This product came when I had no chocolate whatsoever in the house. I  wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when it I saw it. I was surprised by the flavor. The crispiness reminded me of a chip. I am not sure how to feel about that because I am used to my brownies being soft and moist. The taste was good. My kids liked how easy and mess free they were. \n",
  "Holy Moly! This brownie brittle tasted like brownies just dehydrated. They tasted amazing and the bag had more than enough to share with my coworkers. I had people writing the name down, because they love it so much. Overall I would recommend this product.\n",
  "My apologies for taking so long to review this awesome product but once the package came in, it was gone and I completely forgot to review. I checked the mail, got the box and opened it. I got one teeny tiny little piece. My daughter (6) and my husband demolished the entire package within minutes. Minutes!!! This is the BEST Brownie Brittle we have ever had. It&#39;s everything you want brownie brittle to be. Crispy. Chocolatey. Thin. DELICIOUS!!! We are in love!!! \n",
  "my kids loved it will be buying some for sure\n",
  "I have tried the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle and I have to say that they are really good and recommend to all to try it.  I was hooked already brought another package because my kids and my friends kids ate it all.\n",
  "The packaging was fun and cute. The flavor was really good. They are like brownie chips. So addictive. Once you start you cant stop eating them.  Ive never seen them in stores but if I did I would definitely buy them. Lol maybe thats a good thing. ",
  "OMG i want to buy this so bad.   it was so so yummy.  i ate the whole bag in one sitting.  i did give my kids a couple pieces.......small pieces.  haha   definitely on my christmas list for myself.\n",
  "I thought this was aneat idea but hnestly the flavor tasted a little like burnt brownie I don&#39;t know if it was the texture throwing me off but I thought it was cool to make brownie toasted cookies such as theses\n",
  "I really liked these and got 2 bags to try, I woulda loved to have tried the different flavors, but I got the basic one. While I did like these, they were a little too sweet and they had A LOT of crumbs at the bottom. Ihaven&#39;t seen these in the store yet, but when I do, I plan to buy some more.\n",
  "These were so so good, almost better than cookies, or brownies..:)\n",
  "I&#39;m pretty sure I already reviewed this but here it goes again.  \n\nI was excited to try out this brownie brittle.  I can definitely say that it did not stand up to the hype.  I did not like the burnt taste of it and it was way too crispy.  I guess I like brownies that are not burnt and are moist.  My kids on the other hand loved it.  If I buy this again it would be for the kids!\n",
  "When I tried Brownie Brittle I really did enjoy the sweet, chocolaty taste. However, the texture did not appeal to me.  I&#39;m not one of those people that love the edges of the cookie pan. I like my cookie soft and chewy. For those that perfer the edges, Brownie Brittle is your product.\n\n \n\n \n",
  "This tasted pretty good, although hard brownies are not my thing. I prefer soft gooey ones. But if you think of it as a chocolate cracker instead, its pretty good. My daughter liked them as well. ",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is probably one of the best products I have gotten to test through Swaggable so far! I thought the idea was really cute (Crunchy edges of a brownie) but when I got them and opened them up for a taste, my husband and I couldn&#39;t put them down. We just wanted a little snack and ended up enjoying a glass of milk and sharing the whole bag! I was really hoping to find them somewhere local to purchase them but was unable to locate them anywhere here. I did see they sell them online, the price is a tad too high. But if you can control yourself a little better then I did when I tried them, they would be nice for a special treat every now and then. I for sure will be keeping my eyes open for this snack in stores! \n",
  "These are the best snack ever! Its truly like eating a brownie. ",
  "I actually didn&#39;t get to try this product because it didn&#39;t make it to me. I&#39;m sure it is very good and I would have loved to try it but what can ya do right. \n",
  "I love chocochip brownie brittle.Was a great treat to take on a hike or drive.light and flavorful.Just an all around good snack.",
  "These tasted alot better than another brand I tried that made the same type of product. This wasnt too sweet or too crunchy. Tasted just like the corner pieces of brownies! And I ate a whole bag and didnt feel bad. They are really good and good for you ;)!!!\n",
  "Omg these things are AMAZING! They&#39;re really light and crispy but they pack a big flavor, a really sweet little treat for when you want the sweet brownie taste without all  the calories. This Brownie Brittle is great on it&#39;s on but its a really good topping on ice cream. I really wish I could find these in my local stores, I would definately stock up!\n",
  "YUM! The sample size was nice and big so I was able to share with everyone in my home. I loved the light crispness to the brownie brittle. I felt like it was a good way to get a chocolate fix without totally indulging in a naughty snack. I have since seen this product sold at Costco and purchased a larger bag. Goes great with milk!\n",
  "My family enjoyed the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. They tasted like cookie brownies. They were so good i would definitely buy these for my family. I also recommend these to my friends and family. Pure goodness in my mouth. These we so good i didnt even need milk! \n",
  "I am so glad that I applied for this sample.  Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle is addictive!!!  It is great to eat by itself or you can break up the pieces and put it in ice cream.  I just recently bought the &#39;English Toffee&#39; variety at Sam&#39;s Club and it is almost gone. This product is made with natural ingredients and is peanut-free and Kosher, so I guess this is pretty good for you if you are on a diet.  All I know is, that this product is Chocolate goodness in a cookie crunch. \n",
  "These are awesome! I would recommend these everyone. A chocolate lovers delight.\n",
  "So good! Its the best part of the brownie... What more could you ask for!",
  "This was awesome good! Wasnt sure what to expect. It was like the crispy corner brownie that we all fight for! Will definately buy again!",
  "Absolutely delicious! The flavor is super chocolatey, and it&#39;s such a unique product. Whoever came up with the idea of brownie chips is a genius! I&#39;kk definitely buy more :)\n",
  "delicious sample and my kids loved it as well! i just can not find it in stores,  that is my only issue, otherwise it was great trying!\n",
  "Wow!  These are amazing!  Not what I expected as a brittle because its really the crunchy part of the brownie.  You know, the part everyone fights for!  Will definitely buy these again!",
  "I never received my sample but did try the brownie brittle in the grocery store. It was sooo yummy!  Tasted just like the crispy edges off of a brownie, which is my favorite part!  Will absolutely but these again!",
  "great product and completely adictive \n",
  "Well this was a very different snack.  The Brownie Brittle was flavorful and satisfied my chocolate cravings.  But it wasn&#39;t that good because it was very sweet.  The chocolate chips were good.\n",
  "Love this stuff!  It is sweet, crispy, had a lot of chocolate chips and tasted just like I was really eating a brownie!\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was so amazing. From the taste, texture, and smell. I didnt expect them to taste so good. I expected brittle, hard and sticky, but not at all. I would suggest and by for anyone that enjoys chocolate. ",
  "These were absolutely delicious. Looking at them in the bag, I was rather skeptical, but they tasted great!\n",
  "this is a great party snack. I liked the taste and the crunch. the fun factor was that its easy to put out into a party bowl",
  "Everyone at the house loved this. Taste just like a brownie and loved the crunch it has to it. \n",
  "I love brownies and i love brittle this was the best of both worlds i can wait to get my hands on some more of this amazing treat.\n",
  "If you love brownies then you will flip over Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. It has the perfect crunch and tastes exaclty like homemade brownies. Even better, it&#39;s made with natural ingredients and the kids loved it. My youngest daughter even asked to take some to school as her snack. We can&#39;t wait to try the other flavors and see if they are as delicious as the Chocolate Chip.\n",
  "OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this stuff is so good! i couldnt put it down!!!!! best new snack i have had in a long time\n",
  "VERY GOOD new product, LOVED IT!!!!! It was a very crunchy and although it was low fat, you could not tell it like most products, I give 10 stars if I could!!!!!!",
  "The Brownie Brittle sample i recieved was interesting. At first I wasn&#39;t a fan. It reminded me of brunt brownie edges. But after a few days, I decieded to try it on top of ice cream. It was pretty delicious as a topping.\n\nI dont think I would recomend this product, unless they were looking for a way to jazz up a frozen treat.\n",
  "I never recieved this product therefore I remain neutral minded.\n",
  "Too good to be true i think the whole bag was gone walking back from the mailbox :) DELICIOUS! Tasted like imwas eating freah brownies!",
  "My husband ate almost the entire bag. He loved them. I thought they tastes rich with a crispity crunch. \n",
  "Ill start out by saying Im not a huge chocolate person so I was a little worried I wouldnt enjoy my sample of brownie brittle. I couldnt have been more wrong! The delicious deep, rich chocolatey goodness that I enjoy in a brownie is packed into this light, crispy snack that was perfect for my sweet tooth on the go. Sometimes I get turned off by harsh chocolate, but this was the perfect smooth chocolate flavor that I have a hard time sharing. It was also a huge hit with the few that were lucky enough to sample from my sample :) Everyone also enjoyed the coupons for a bit of savings on this little guilty pleasure!",
  "I wasn&#39;t always one to like the crispy part of brownies...I&#39;m more of a fudgy, gooey center part of brownies gal. But I really liked these Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle&#39;s...they were perfect for satisfying my sweet tooth occasionally, and I loved dunking them in my coffee or my hot chocolate. The flavor was spot on, and I liked the added chocolatey-ness of the chocolate chips. I would absolutely buy these in the store. My boyfriend also happened to love them, and finished the bag before I could have more than a couple of servings! \n",
  "I like the product, it was light and chocolatey.\n",
  "Omg This was awsome. It was crunchy and sweet and just hit the spot. Between my kids and I it was gone in a minute flat!\n",
  "The Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle was a Big Hit in my house.   It had a really great flavor and everyone loved them.  \n",
  "This is a great snack!  A great way to get the taste of a brownie without the guilt of eating a whole brownie.\n",
  "At first when I signed up to get this I wasn&#39;t sure that I would like it. I was WRONG!!! When making brownies my favorite part is the crispy edges and with this, it was all crispy. My kids loved and and it wasn&#39;t as messy as a regular brownie would be. It is a great and easy snack to take with you, if you are craving something sweet and when you don&#39;t want to wake to make actuall brownies. I would deffiently get this again.\n",
  "Chocolate chip brownie brittle is soo good I think it would be hard not to finish a full sized bag. It definitely fills my chocolate craving and I dont feel too guilty after indulging.",
  "I was provided a complementary sample of the  Brownie Brittle™ snacks by Sheila G. This snack is a very unusual one, but very tasty ans satisfying. Highly recommend.\n",
  "Brownie brittle? Holy crap. Everyone loves the crunchy edge pieces, so naturally these are absolutely delicious and ingenious. They have really authentic taste of brownies without tasting in the slighest bit cheap or fake. These things are fantastic with milk or to eat alone. The baked brownies are crispy just like a potato chip and the chocolate chips melt in your mouth. Great movie night snack. [: I&#39;ll absolutely be purchasing these again for treats. \n",
  "These are so good, they&#39;re addictive! I&#39;ve never been a fan of the sticky brownies, but these have just the right crunch to them!\n",
  "I really really enjoyed this bag of Brownie Brittle.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this snack was. I ate it by itself and i even got creative and used it as an icecream topping. I have a 2 year old daughter and she enjoyed them as well. I actually bought a bag at Sam&#39;s Club last week!\n",
  "Normally I love brittle products.  I was not at all impressed with this product.  It tasted chalky and did not have much of a brownie flavor.\n",
  "And now I&#39;m addicted.  Just the perfect sweetness and the crunch is awesome. Tastes like an actual brownie!\n",
  "i loved this product it was very crispy and is very allergy friendly for those who want snacks who are not allergic my sister said it is a very low points for weight watchers which she is on so i got my sister hooked thank you\n",
  "By far one of the most like home cooked brownie tastes Ive ever had out of a bag. Its crunchy like a cookie with the taste & flavor of a brownie. Definitely a snack worth buying, everyone in my house loved it. I will definitely be buying a lot more if this. I recently found BIG bags at Costco, now that I know what it tastes like Ill be picking some up. ",
  "I recently tasted Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle and LOVED it.  I thought that it was a great new way to eat a brownie.  I really enjoyed how it tasted like the crisp edges of the brownie after baking, although my family said it tasted like an overdone chocolate cookie with chocolate chips.  They didnt care for it.  I don&#39;t think I woulld purchase this product based on the fact that my family wouldnt eat it.  I don&#39;t like to buy treats if they aren&#39;t going to be enjoyed by everyone in the family.\n",
  "This was absolutely delicious! It was easy to make and my boys and I loved it. It&#39;s great that it is low in calories. My favorite part is that the whole browny is crispy rather than just the edges. \n",
  "I liked the product. Could probably make it yourself by spreading brownie batter in a bigger pan to make it extra thin. It was very easy to just keep munching. If you like the crunchy part of brownies on the outside of the pan then this is a snack you will enjoy.\n",
  "loved the taste of this brownie will be getting it in the future\n",
  "I loved the Sheila G. Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. Given that it&#39;s a healthier alternative, I honestly expected it to taste like cardboard. I was pleasantly surprise to find the product was true to its claims. It had the crunch of brittle and the true chocolate taste of a brownie. I definitely intend to buy this product in the future.\n",
  "I couldn&#39;t stay out of this bag! The brittle is extremely addictive. The whole family had it gone within the hour. I would definitely buy this product and have seen it sold in my local Toys R Us store. This is a must try!\n",
  "Oh my goodness! What can I say about the tastiest brownie edges I&#39;ve ever tasted! I would and I did recommend this brownie brittle to friends. I shared with my friends and it was a big hit. It seems that Sheila G has figured out how to get one of the best parts of brownies in a bag - get out of my head! I still have to get out and find more but I will will when I&#39;m able. \n",
  "Omg I loved these. I wish I could find them around here because  I ate the whole bag in 2 days. So so delicious! I usually like chewy fudgy brownies but these were so good in the taste, texture and everything overall!!!",
  "These Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittles were actually better than I expected! The whole family loved them!\n",
  "I enjoyed it for what it was worth. Im a lover of food so almost anything tastes good to me. Couldve sat there and ate more but my samples were limited :-) I would Def recommend it to my healthy eating friends who need some sweetness in their life. Would I buy it on the other hand? Im half and half on that. My sweet tooth is sweeter than that so Idk. Tt",
  "Another great sample provided by Swaggable! Brownie Brittle is an interesting concept. When you think of a Brownie you think of soft, chewy and chocolate-y. For Brittle you assume it&#39;s going to be hard and crunchy (like peanut brittle). Brownie Brittle seems like it&#39;s hard but as soon as you put it in your mouth it seems to melt and then becomes slightly chewy (a little more chewiness would have been perfect - maybe for version 2.0?). Overall enjoyed the product and definitely looking forward to new flavors and/or versions!\n",
  "This stuff is heaven in a bag!!! Its the perfect flavor, like right of the oven made brownies. No overly chocolate flavor, not chalky, and not crispy crunchy like I expected. He perfect little snack without the fuss of baking!",
  "I was really excited when I got an offer to try this product as the bf had seen it on tv and really wanted to try it.  The best way to describe Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle is by saying it tastes like the top crunchy layer of fresh baked brownies, with an extra hint of chocolate chips. Since, I personally like my brownies nice and soft, this product wasn&#39;t exactly my cup of tea. However, I must admit, the flavor was incredible and tasted just like home made brownies. The bf on the other hand, LOVED the brownie brittle and pretty much devoured the entire bag on his own. I guess I should add that he loves crispy brownies. hahaha\n",
  "These were so amazingly good! I couldnt put the bag down between me and my 7 year old son who also enjoyed them very much we ate the whole bag in one day! They tasted just like the crispy part of the brownie! I would definatly buy these!\n",
  "To be honest I have not yet received my sample.Waiting  to give it a try.",
  "my husband and family loved these!! They were very tastey and well worth the amount the amount in the bag.. \n",
  "I absolutely loved these! My kids loved them too! I had to go and buy some!",
  "Really didnt enjoy this browies dry andnot moist and very hard not cruchy but hard. Maybe I disliked this roduct because I am use to the tradition brownies moist and rich and soft. I am very unhappy to say I did not enjoy this product",
  "Great on the go snack... Good thing to bring into the office for those need something sweet moments...",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie so yummuy ...I enjoyed it ...Yes recommend this..\n",
  "I can&#39;t say enough good things about Brownie Brittle. The taste is amazing, the texture is incredible, light and crunchy. The only problem is you don&#39;t want to stop eating them!\n",
  " If you love brownie edges then this snack is for you! Think chocolate flavored chips. :) just the crisp edges of the brownie and nothing else! ",
  "I was not able to personally try this. My 2 sons opened both packages before I got home =/ they said they loved it & wanted me to buy more. They said it tastes just like a crispy brownie. I apologise im not able to elaborate. I will try & do so after my purchase.  Lol ",
  "Thought these little bites were absolutely delicious, just the right about of chocolate and calories for the taking!  Would recommend them to anyone with the self-control to just eat a few bites...ha!  Yum!\n",
  "I was so happy this was so good. This was sweet enough, and had plenty of choco taste. I like the cruch but it wasn&#39;t hard, it is just like the crispy bits on the outsides of brownies.....YUM!\n",
  "This was the best!  It had the edge brownie crunchiness and ever so chocolate!  Love this!",
  "I absolutely loved this!  It was so delicious!  I loved the chocolate chucks and the crispy bites!  I wanted more, so I went out and bought some!",
  "There could not be a more delicious snack when i&#39;m craving something sweet but don&#39;t want to break the calorie bank! Delicious, cruncy, chocolatey, and little chunks of chocolate chips sprinked throughout! It&#39;s the best part of a pan of brownies, without the guilt of the whole pan sitting in the kitchen tempting me! (LOL) My husband and MIL both helped themselves to a serving and were shocked at how delicious these were! I was surprised that my husband liked them as much as he did, seeing as usually he&#39;s not keen to trying new things like this -- especially if it&#39;s a brownie not homeade by his wife. My MIL devoured a bag with me and was shocked to see the calorie content in a serving...she couldn&#39;t believe it! She thought I was fooling her. I understand the sugar content is still high, but I&#39;m thankful to have a sweet treat that doesn&#39;t break the bank. Everything in moderation. But finally a little something sweet that I really can enjoy! Yum! :)\n",
  "Kids ate this before I got a chance to try it, guess it most have been good.\n",
  "I&#39;d like to say I was able to try this one, but my kids found it before I did. They definitely gobbled it up and were begging for more. I&#39;m keeping an eye out for it so I can enjoy some myself!\n",
  "I really wish I had a few more bags.  I loved it and so did my kids.  I had to hide it so I could eat it lol.  Great product!\n",
  "I thought I had written the review on this product. I had more fun using this as cereal than anything else. My issue it they need bigger bags not enough to share\n",
  "I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when I first saw these little tidbits as a sample to try. They got here in a timely manner and was eager to see what they were all about. I opened the package and gave em a try. To my delight, they were yummy. More crisp than crunchy and just enough sweey and chocolate to satisfy any craving. Would also be a great snack for on the go, road trips or even hiking. I would happily buy these if I saw them in the store.\n",
  "A low calorie chocolate snack that actually tastes like chocolate instead of chocolate-flavored styrofoam? Hand it over! Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle was delicious, satisfying, and devoured in about 45 seconds. It reminded me of those yummy, crunch corners of fresh-baked brownies- which happens to be my absolute favorite indulgent dessert. I absolutely loved that I could eat something so delicious and delectable and it not require my entire daily caloric allowance. I would absolutely recommend this delicious snack to anyone! In fact, I&#39;m craving chocolate as we speak, and I could really use a bag of brownie brittle!\n",
  "This item should be renamed Heaven. Oh my gosh, it&#39;s perfect for little chocolate treat before bed. If you love the corner piece of brownies, like me this is for you - everyone in the house wins! And for the momma&#39;s watching their weight it&#39;s only 120 Calories. You can&#39;t get better than that\n",
  "I love this awesome snack! It is crunchy, chocolatey and oh so yummy! I will buy it when I find it at our local grocery store!\n",
  "I liked the brownie brittle to an extent. I really wasn&#39;t impressed. It tasted like a tiny, crunchy chocolate cookie that had no substinance. It wasn&#39;t a very good snack or anything, there just wan&#39;t enough thickness to the brittle to make it anything other than a taste.\n",
  "I loveed how the Choclate Brownie Brittle tasted exactly like a brownie but I found it rather crunchy and crispy (just like brittle is suppose to be).  I&#39;m not the biggest fan of brittle.  I also am not the biggest fan of the corner pieces of brownies.  The flavor of the chocolate is really good and not too rich.  I liked the chocolate chips inside of the brownie brittle.  I found that the pieces broke a little too easily and that there was a lot of crumbs found at the bottom of the bag.  I ended up just adding them to milk in a blender.  I&#39;ll say, if given the choice between a real brownie and Brownie Brittle, I&#39;ll take the brownie any day even though this product tastes good.\n",
  "Absoultly delious and I don&#39;t know what I was expecting exactly but I was very surprised by the fresh taste and the crispiness of it and a quick note to everyone (if you dip it in milk it softens up and tastes even better with the milk soaked up in it). Hard to believe that something that tastes this good is low in calories....Great product and I recommend it to everyone!!!!\n",
  "I loved this product.The flavor was awesome.I was a bit weary at first because of missing and broken teeth.My worries were soon put at ease.The airiness of the texture made it easy to chew.Wonderful product all the way around.\n",
  "First i had to pay for shipping on this item. 6$+ to be exact. the bite were yummy.\n",
  "I loved these things! They were thin but not hard and tasted delicioua.\n",
  "I absoultely love these brownie brittles. I love brownies and my favorite is the hard pieces around the corners when you make brownies. These are perfect and taste delicious. I&#39;ve eaten them quite a few times since receiving a free sample.\n",
  "I had never heard of Brownie Brittle before recieving my free sample and I&#39;m not sure how that is possible.  Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle is amazing!  I had to fight my husband off because this is so delicious.  I was extremely happy to find this product at Costco so we stay stocked in our house now.\n",
  "The chcolate chip brownie brittle is the perfect snack. It gives you the crunchy edges of the brownies that we love so much! They are delicious and full of great chocolaty flavor!! \n",
  "this brownie brittle was so awesome,i ate it all in one sitting.will definatelly recommend to my friends\n",
  "I just moved and was really disappointed that this product did not find me. Looking forward to my next sample. \n",
  "This is great sruff it is so good. love the crunchy sweet taste of these fine candies.\n",
  "I have never tried Brownie Brittle before so I was not sure how it would end up. But overall, I really like the cripsiness of the brownie. It tasted a little bit different from brownies that I usually make, but that is not a bad thing. I thought it tasted pretty good.\n",
  "i loved this stuff crispy   and chocolaty  it solved both my munch craving in one bag\n",
  "The brownie Brittle was a big hit with my coworkers.  I was a little hesitant at first but it really is a great product.  I like my brownies chewy but these are crispy and still just as good.  I am able to purchase these at my local grocery store, so it makes the sampling worthwhile.  I was able to try before investing money in a product I was unsure of.\n",
  "The Brownie Brittle was wonderfully chocolately and crunchy...I love the fact that these have an ultra rich genuine chocolate flavor.\n",
  "My daughter and I loved this.  We have bought every flavor of the brownie batter products.  This is a great snack to take along on a long trip.  It is good and not messy at all.  It also helps that it is low on calories!  I would recommend this to anyone!\n",
  "This was an overall decadent treat. I loved it I wanted more I didn&#39;t want to share it with anyone. In a word Indulgent!\n",
  "They tasted good and all but the majority of them were broken into tiny crumbs. Also the product is quite expensive considering what it is and that you could probably make it yourself.\n",
  "These are a great snack and the whole family loved them. They were chocolaty and crispy. Very good.",
  "I loved these chocolate chip brownie brittle. What a great chocolate taste. I really like to eat the hard ends of brownies when I make them at home and these tasted exactly like that. I would definitely recommend these to anyone.",
  "these are the best ever so good and soooo addictiing hard to stop eating :)\n",
  "I was able to try Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle thanks to Swaggable and I am glad I did! This delectable little treat is great for adults and children, even though this adult didn&#39;t particularly want to share. It&#39;s the taste of a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie all rolled in to one and provides just the right amount of crunch. I highly recommend this snack for anyone who is a chocolate lover! \n",
  "The brownie brittle snacks is a big hit in my house! Everyone loves the crispy crunchiness & that its also all natural. ",
  "Love brownie brittle!! I have bought several bags since this review!  It crunches like a cookie, or well, brittle..but taste like a brownie!  My husband who does not care for chocolate much loves these too!",
  "It tastes better than I expected! completely exceeded my expectations!\n",
  "Honestly, I didn&#39;t think I would like it but it was really good and addicting.  It has a good chocolate flavor.\n",
  "Loved this. \n\nI had never heard of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle before I received the sample and I was very pleasantly surprised. What a wonderful delicious snack. This was most definitely one of the best snacks I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure to try and I can&#39;t rave enough about it. If there&#39;s ever a snack out there that makes anyone say WOW YUM OMG Amazing....this is it. If you hvaen&#39;t tried it already you need to. I love the texture, it&#39;s the texture of a chip , but looks like a super thinly sliced Brownie. Very cool.. This is perfect for anyone who wants to try something other than a Tortilla chip or a Potato chip, a wonderful snack. \n",
  "when i got this product i was so happy to see 2 nice size bages. I love them. The crunch and flavor are so good. great product\n",
  "These were really good, taste just like a brownie. Thim and crunchy like chipw definitely satisfies that chip and chocolate cravings.  I woukd definitely buy these and I wouldnt share my bag butnwould recommend them for sure.",
  "So great! The brownie was intense and very satisfying. I ate the whole bag. Very addictive.\n",
  "I was Leary about trying this but figured chocolate was worth a shot. So glad I did!!! Brownie brittle is my new favorite treat. I love the crispy edges to the brownies and thats what it reminded me of. ",
  "My kids and I absolutely loved brownie brittle! it&#39;s a crunchy and delicious brownie... like having the corner pieces (my favorites) all in one bag! My daughter could not get enough! Infact we are still buying these delicious little bags!\n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle sample! The bomb, and off the hook, Really good trust me. once you starte to eat them you really cant stop. were really good just the right amount of brittle in it, And I am a chocolate chip brownie lover so they were the bomb once you start to eat them you cant stop trust me and try them\n",
  "I was so excited when I received Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle in the mail - a free sample fro Swaggable! It was SOOOOO GOOOOODDDDD! I was really impressed with the taste and texture of these browine bits. I&#39;m a huge fan of the crispy outsides of brownies and these are the EXACT same taste! I loved that they included a coupon and I&#39;ve been on the hunt for these to purchase ever since. I love that they are relatively low in calories and they are are so chocolatey! So good. Do yourself a favor and try to find these... you won&#39;t be sorry!\n",
  "I have always been a sucker for chocolate. But I don&#39;t always want the over-indulgent brownies (not to mention going through the effort of having to round up ingredients and bake them), yet I want something a little more flavorful and varied in texture than a simple cookie or chocolate bar. Prior to sampling Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle I had heard of the stuff, but had never tried it. Now? I&#39;m hooked.\n\nBrownie Brittle is simply the crispy, somewhat hardened edges of brownies, but make no mistake - they&#39;re not burnt, nor are they overly crunchy. Instead, they seem to offer the right combination of chewiness and crunch, with plenty of chocolate flavor to go around. Of the flavors I tried, I liked Chocolate Chip and Toffee Crunch the best, and would definitely order them again!\n",
  "This brownie brittle was tasty and a perfect treat. We paired it with vanilla bean icecream and it was simply fabulous.\n",
  "Love is all I have to say to these too bad I have been diagnosed with celiac cause I would just eat these all day. ",
  "These were DELICIOUS! My family is such a big fan that we treat ourselves with purchasing a family size bag at Costco, ever since we&#39;ve sampled this. I prefer crunchy snacks and the fact that these were the right consistency with a perfect sweet flavor. Great packaging as well with the resealable bag. \n",
  "I&#39;m typically a very chewy brownie kind of girl, so I was a little hesitant about the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle.\n\nBoy was I wrong! They were absolutely delicious! The Brownie Brittle really helped with my overpowering chocolate craving.  The only problem I can forsee is eating the whole bag in one sitting. Definitely not for those who have zero self control!\n",
  "loved them, took them to work and were gone within 30 mintutes\n",
  "I REALLY DIDNT LIKE IT, WAS TOO HARD TO MY LIKING. BUT THE FLAVOR WAS GOOD\n",
  "I was a little hesitant on tasting brownie chips but was pleasantly surprised at the taste.  They are a little thicker than chips, which is great since you get more flavor in each bite.  They are very chocolately and surprisingly moist in your mouth.  I went out and bought a few bags immediately since they were such a hit in my house!\n",
  "It wasn&#39;t that great.. it was hard and tasted kind of... IDK theright word?... What does ceramic taste like? I probably woulnd&#39;t eat this again.. The flavor was... off?... I like the idea though. That was fun. =)\n",
  "I really enjoyed the taste of this product! I love the crunchy outside of the brownies, so this was perfect for me!. I would definitely buy this product!\n",
  "I was nervous about how this would taste, but it&#39;s really good! I was quite surprised. It&#39;s like a crisp chocolate cookie. yum!\n",
  "I was very excited to receive and then try this delicious Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle! As a brownie Lover it did not disappoint! The crispy edges and mouth watering rich chocolate are a must try for all! I have bought more than I care to admit.....and would most definitely recommend to ALL!",
  "I really enjoyed this product. It has the taste of a brownie but the crunch of brittle. It wasn&#39;t too hard either like brittle can be.\n",
  "I thought that the brownie brittle tagged excellent. The only problem with it was there were lots of crumbs,I dont know if yr was grim shipping then it if it was standard.",
  "I dont like the edges of brownies, I prefer the soft middle so I wasnt expecting to like this at all. Boy was I wrong! I loved them and will buy a big bag to take on trips as a nice sweet treat alternative to candy bars. ",
  "I got to try the chocolate chip brownie brittle from swaggables an I gave to say those are the best I have ever had they taste just like brownies from right out of the oven thanks from letting me try those for free I would tell everyone to try them out they will love them.",
  "The brownie brittle was so good really flavorfull and it tasted likethe brownie edges the best part of the brownies\n",
  "it&#39;s yummy and tasty. my kids love them too\n",
  "Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle wow what a mind trick these guys play on your brain. it&#39;s like opening the hot oven up to so yummy smelling hot fresh brownies, but now all you need to do is pop open a bag! and of course without the warmth of the oven. These were pretty awesome and my family and freidns loved them as well. I am glad i was able to try them out. Thanks again Swaggable for allowing me to try out such cool products for free!\n",

  "The brownie brittle was awesome loved it \n",
  "This brownie brittle was something I had never tried but have since bought many times.  It is simply delicious and full of flavor.  There are chunks of chocolate that do actually melt in your mouth.  It is simply like eating a crispy brownie.  I would recommend this to any and everyone,",
  "O my goodness these were delicious. I loved them . Definitely will buy them.",
  "I didn&#39;t enjoy these very much at all. They were very dry and crumby and tasted a little burnt. Not what I was expecting at all. I was expecting something more like actual brittle or toffee, not the overtoasted bits of brownie batter. I was very disappointed.\n",
  "Brownie brittle has an unexpected and addictive crunch and sweetness! I couldn&#39;t stop at just a few!\n",
  "Absolutely LOVED the Brownie Brittle I recently sampled. I would recommend this to friends and family. \n",
  "Brownie Brittle is AMAZING!  The thin crunchy wafers taste just like the crunchy end of a brownie, but thinner and lighter.  They are pretty low-cal considering they are so delicious so they are a pretty guilt-free treat but still feels like a complete splurge because they are so rich and delicious!\n",
  "I didn&#39;t get a chance to eat this, but kids did.  They loved it and wanted me to buy some more\n",
  "This product has somehow captured the flavones of brittle and brownie all in a delicious square. These are good for the little and big ones. ",
  "I love this - chocolately, crunchy, yummy!!  Perfect for a chocolate crunch fix!!\n",
  "This stuff is amazing my whole family loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
  "I&#39;m sure these were delicious for the people who recieved them. I was supposed to recieve these around the same time that I was moving and never got them. Other than that. I&#39;m going to rate them high just because they look tasty and fun. \n",
  "I enjoyed these. They tasted great. My teen thought they were too crunchy and my husband too sweet but that&#39;s exactly what I expected from the name. I would buy them.\n",
  "These were amazing! Had amazing flavor for chocolate lovers, great crunch, and a great portion for a sample! I would recommend these to anyone!!\n",
  "OMG!!! I absolutely love these. They taste exactly like the edge of brownies. They have that crunchy texture but melt in your mouth. My daughter and I ate the whole bag they sent but luckily they sent two with a 50 cents off coupon for a additional one. I was very surprised by the flavor and no greasy feel or after taste in your mouth. I would diffinitly recommend these to everybody. A must to experience.",
  "I was really exceited to receive the invite for the chocolate chip brownie brittle and when they finally arrived I was not dissappointed. I have always enjoyed brittle but chocolate chip brownie brittle is delicious and addicting. I shared with my twelve year old daughter who really loved this as well. \n",
  "Chocolate chip brownie brittle had a great chocolate crunch to it . I loved the crunch and the flavor ! Its a great snack when you are craving something sweet !\n",
  "These little brownie bites were simply amazing!! almost tasted as if I was eating a real brownie! Ive been buying them well after I had my sample!\n",
  "THIS PRODCUT WAS MELSTED AND ALL MASHED WHEN I GOT IT SO I USED IT AS A CRUMBLE TOPPING FOR ICE CREAM AND A FEW OTHER DESSERT TOPPINGS LOVED THE TAST AND TEXTUR \n",
  "I love these Choclate Chip Brownie Brittl. They are very crunchy and also a little to sweet. I only could eat a piece at a time with it being so sweet. Just make surre you have so milk when eating these. \n",

  "This is a great snack for anyone who loves brownies especially the crunchy edges. I liked that it is low in calories so it allows me to indulge a bit more and my kids absolutely loved it  and the fact it is made with natural ingredients was a plus for allowing them to have it as a snack.  I loved the richness it has as well as the crunchiness, now my kids have to have it when we see it in the store.\n",
  "Love the crispy crunchy and its good for you too\n",
  "I loved it, it was crunchy but taste like brownies. I always leave brownies in the oven longer to try and get them crunchy.\n",

  "The are very delicious! Between my two kids and husband they were gone in 5 minutes! A little dry but over all fantastic! I wasnt expecting such a great snack! Its amazing!",
  "It was okay.  It didn&#39;t have the taste I expected.  Then again, I don&#39;t like the crispy edge of brownies very much, so...   \n",
  "Taste great and very convenient for a snack on the go.",
  "These are addictive--I could eat the whole bag in one sitting because they are so crispy and light. Only issue is that they crumble easily. Half of the bag was crumbs due to being thrown around while in transit.\n",
  "The brownie brittle was tasty but too crunchy for me!\n",
  "I consider this snack to be a enjoyable Chocolaty potatoe chip. To be honest, I was surprised by the taste. I assumed this was just going to be another snack that claims to taste great at less calories; expecting to taste like cardboard. Absolutely did NOT. I still purchase the brownie brittles at Sams Club for myself and family. \n",
  "Totally addicting...ate the whole bag in one sitting. Very crunchy and delicious. They are thin and crisp and some have chocalate chips still on them. I buy this constantly\n",
  "I got brownie brittle in the mail as a sample. My kids and I love it I cant wait for it to come to a store near me. I will buy this product and I wil recommend it to everyone I know. Any one that loves brownies and hate all the extra calories I suggest you to try these. They remind me of my favorite part of a pan of brownies which it the edge and they are crunchy and soft at the same time. \n",
  "Really delicious snack!  Has all the chocolate and brownie flavor you want!  Only thing is they aren&#39;t great presented outside of the bag like if you have company.\n",
  "If you love the crispy edgies of Brownies like I do, you absolutely have to try Sheila G&#39;s Brownie Brittle!!!! Every last bite is full of Chocolatey Crunchy yummyiness!! There&#39;s just one problem: You won&#39;t want to share :P At 120 Calories per ounce, you can indulge without the guilt! They are available at Minit Market and other places near you ;)\n",
  "I LOVE Sheila G&#39;s Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle. It was so good!! It wasn&#39;t overly sweet and had the best texture. I will certainly be buying this myself.\n",
  "So amazing. We loved it and now purchase it all the time. Its become a staple in our house. ",
  "Our family is notorious for snacking during our games. It can be difficult for me sometimes as I try to watch my calorie intake. I pulled out my bag of Brownie Brittle during a game of cards one night, thinking that it would be MY sweet treat, and everyone kept passing the bag around... There were about 6 around the table and the bag was gone in 10 minutes!\n\nCrunchy, sweet- but not TOO sweet... a nice combination of just the right texture and flavor. Even though it&#39;s low in calorie, everyone loved it!\n",
  "I really wanted to love this product because it sounded so delicious.  Honestly, though, it was too sweet.  It had a great chocolate flavor, but the sweetness overwhelmed everything else.  I couldn&#39;t eat more than a few bites at a time, let alone a full serving at one time.\n\n \n\nAlso, I&#39;m the type of person who prefers chewy brownies over crispy ones.  This brittle definitely reminds me of the crispy tops of a pan of brownies.  I know that there are plenty of people out there who love that part of brownies, and this product would be perfect for those people.\n\n \n\nI hadn&#39;t thought of this before, but I bet this product would have been better, at least to me, if I had crumbled it and used it to top ice cream or frozen yogurt.  It would have to be a small amount, but that would have been fine since I only ate a small amount at a time anyway.  Perhaps I might buy this product (if I can find it in stores) so I can try it this way.  I have a feeling that with the right kind of ice cream or yogurt, the balance of sweetness and other flavors would be much better.\n",
  "I really enjoyed the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle by Sheila G. It has the best piece of the brownie, the crusty taste. \n",
  "This was my first experience with this product, but not my last. Brownie brittle was so delicious, that I have already bought two other flavor options to enjoy. If you like brownies, and love chocolate (these are intensely chocolaty), youll love these. Buy some today!",
  "Didnt really like them too hard not enough chocolate",
  "Very choclately! Pieces are thin and crisp. A bit too crumbly for my liking. They would be good crumbled over ice cream. \n",
  "Amazing taste with a great crunch. This hit the sweet toooth spot with also fufilling the need to eat something crunch",
  "Definitelty an interesting product.  I wasnt a hige fan but everyone else loved it!",
  "These were delicious!  I brought them out when I had a small get together at my place and they were gobbled up in minutes!  I definitely recommend trying these out.\n",
  "Overall, These tasted good, but if I am gonna eat a brownie, I want an ooey gooey one, not so much crunchy. If you like crunchy brownies-this is a wonderful product and great idea!",
  "What a delicious and unique snack!  These brownies/cookies are really crispy with the taste of a chocolate brownie and a chocoloate chip cookie.  I could not stop eating these and ate the entire bag in 2 days.  They are perfect for a snack or dessert.  My only negative comment is that they do contain alot of sugar.\n",
  "I really wish they made this in bigger bags..lol jk. thats how addicting these Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle are. My whole family loved the Brittle. Chocolate has always been a fovorite in my family. You can snack on these any time of day or night without feeling quilty with only 120 calories per ounce...now that is amazing! now hurry run out and buy yourself a bag or two.\n",
  "I found the Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle to be tasty.  It has a yummy chocolate taste and each bite is crunchy.  If you love the crunchy edges of home made brownies then this is a perfect snack.\n",
  "I loved the crispy LIGHT brownie brittle, didn&#39;t feel like I was overindulging and the flavor was amazing!\n",
  "We weren&#39;t too thrilled with this product.  Tasted weird as it&#39;s an over cooked brownie...   I won&#39;t be purchasing this product.\n",
  "This Brownie Brittle was a great little treat. It is perfect for a quick snack, and very tasty. Goes wonderful with a tall glass of ice cold milk to wash it down with too. My kids even enjoyed it!\n",
  "I have always loved brownie brittle. It tastes amazing. Brownies and cookies are by far my Fav. Now they are all in one! ",
  "This was a delicious product like none I have tasted before. It was satisfying and really hit the right notes for me and my sweet tooth!\n",
  "It was great and tasted even better than I expected\n",
  "This is not something i would ordinarily buy, but it was pretty good! My 3 kids liked it and thought it was Beyer than regular brownies!  They were very crispy and crunchy,  almost like eating brownie chips.   ",
  "We recieved a sample bag of Chocolate Chip Brownie Brittle  and it was delicious . It really does taste like the  edges of a brownie . This is also not a diet buster , so it is a win - win for everybody . I would definitly recommend this to everyone who loves the edges of a brownie . \n",
  "Tasted awesome. Love love love the crunch! Great chocolate flavor"
